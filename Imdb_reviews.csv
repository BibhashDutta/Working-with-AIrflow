Besides a soulful score by Ajay Atul, this adaptation of Ramayana is a baffling and collosal dissapointment.My Rating : 15/100Adipurush is a disgusting mockery of a beloved and celebrated chapter of Indian Mythology. Baring the intimidating Sharad Kelkar's voice and Ajay Atul's profound score, nothing really clicks in this modern adaptation. Om Raut's precarious attempt is a monumental disaster in every aspects of filmaking. Starting from the caricaturish character design of Raavan, cartoonish rendering of the banar sena , cringe dialogues & hurried screenplay everything forces us to bash this misfire. Some salvageable performanaces by Kriti Sanon and Devdatta Nage isnt quite enough to save this project. A mere cash-grabbing project with no acknowledgement of the source material , relying only to play with the Indian sentiments is the prime idea behind this.A proper case of poor casting, whoever decided to cast the stone faced Prabhas to portray the vibrant character of Ram should be easily disbanded from his casting career. A complete misfit as he stirs through with no expressions on his face. Entire film is shot in dark, in order to hide the already flawed CGI. Thor's Asgard is colour graded to black and they have the new Lanka. Wtf are you serious Om Raut? The entire films goes by and i couldn't find anything which i could have related or brought back home. A tiring adaptation to say the least.Overall, if you wish to see this film even if you re a Prabhas fan, you will be largely dissapointed. Only Prasanth Neel's Salaar can revive his degrading career. My suggestion would be to skip this in Theatres and show your kids the Yugo Sako animated version of The Legend of Prince Rama or Ramanand Sagar's version if ever you want them to learn this beautiful epic.Instagram & Twitter : @streamgenx.

1,18 June 2023," Pathetic Ramayan parody
","
Adipurush, if one remembers, was supposed to be an modern adaptation of Ramayan and hence the makers chose to have a free run with the creative liberties in this film and it all went wrong .Adipurush itself starts from the middle of Ramayana where lord Ram was sent to the jungles for 14 years exile . Hence the film doesn't have any build up to any character.First, the characters itself have no introduction whatsoever. Makers assume since we know Ramayana, so no need to introduce anyone properly. Lord Ram is just introduced through some pictures in the opening credit while laxman and Sita ma have even further lower introduction. Honestly saying if one didn't tell you that Sunny Singh is laxman, you probably won't know. Jatayu pops up randomly and gets to poorest adieu . It's almost as if Lord Ram doesn't even know who Jatayu is. Bali , the brother of Sugreev, has absolutely no introduction.Next, the setting. If it's a modern adaptation of Ramayana, then why is the Lord Ram side shown to be taken straight from Ramayana but Lanka and it's people especially Raavan are shown as people of some Azguard (Thor) ? Clearly there is inconsistency . If you remember the original Ramayana, both Ram and Raavan side had almost similar kind of dresses with kings wearing king like dresses etc. Here, both sides wear dresses belonging to opposite poles.Next, the execution. It's horrendous. Bali and Sugreev's fight is the worst looking one which gets over in no time without any introduction to Bali. As they fight, you can't even understand who is Bali and who is Sugreev. The part where Sita gets kidnapped by the Sadhu is not accurate. The Sadhu i believe never gave evil smiles . Jatayu's adieu is just ignored. In the earlier Ramayana, Jatayu has a heartfelt conversation with lord Ram in his arms before dying but here, Jatayu is just treated like a random bird. Last but not the least, everything on the lankan side is so poorly executed. Lord Hanuman burns Lanka with his tail but it barely burns, just random explosions here and there that's it.Next, I want to talk about Indrajith and Vibhishan. My god what kind of portrayal is this? Indrajit looks like a party animal from some Noida club and he possesses powers of Flash !! The level of creative liberties they took!! Vibhishan is so hard to believe he's vibhishan as he doesn't act like him only . They all got weird tattoos on their body especially indrajith . Itna bhi modern nahi karna tha !!VFX and dialogues. Let's not talk about it you already know how it is. The final war sequence also looks so cartoonish that it sucks the essence out of it.Let's talk about Raavan played by Saif. He does try very hard to make Raavan look menacing. His character is even given a terrifying bgm . However, the rest things of his looks so weird. His 10 heads rendered VFX looks hilarious at best. His hairstyle is again Noida Gurugram style. He feeds non veg to his dragon vehicle (why is non veg shown in this film at first place?). All these creative choices just don't fit Raavan. The makers have just played around with the Lanka side while fearfully avoiding any creative changes on Ram side .Songs are good as well as the BGM. That's the only reason I gave this film 2 stars.Prabhas as lord Ram should never have been there. He's just angry faced , barely smiles and has no expressions at all. His body is an entire VFX render throughout.Overall, i thought KBKJ was the worst film this year but Adipurush beats it by a mile solely because it has ruined an epic saga so close to all Hindus. Adipurush just shows a part of the entire Ramayana that too with little to no detailing with its running time being 3 hrs and back in 1992, the Yugo Sako version showed all details and the entire tale of Ram in under 2hrs 50 mins. It clearly shows the quality difference of the makers .

2,16 June 2023," How can someone make a movie that bad ?

Summary:
Adipurush, a movie supposedly based on the Hindu mythology Ramayan, proves to be a disastrous departure from tradition. With its misguided choices in visual effects, abysmal dialogues, and language inconsistencies, the film misses the mark on multiple levels.Detailed Review:
A question to the director and the other heads, how can you be so irresponsible while making this masterpiece of a story into something trash? The blatant disregard for retaining the original character personalities is appalling. Ravan, a Brahmin devotee of Shiv, known for his vegetarianism, is completely transformed in this movie, which not only disrespects the original mythology but also has the potential to hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus.Let's talk about the VFX, or rather the lack thereof. Despite having a higher budget than Brahmastra, Adipurush fails to achieve even a fraction of the visual effects quality. It's clear that more effort should have been put into fixing the VFX instead of just superficially color grading the scenes.The dialogues in Adipurush reach new depths of mediocrity. While attempting to portray a more modern interpretation, the filmmakers fail to put in the necessary effort to create dialogues that can be understood and appreciated by any generation. The result is a disjointed and poorly crafted script that leaves viewers cringing and yearning for substance.In conclusion, my disappointment with Adipurush is immeasurable, and it truly ruined my day. The film's disregard for character authenticity, subpar VFX, and atrocious dialogues render it an abysmal cinematic experience. It fails to deliver on its promise of an engaging and respectful adaptation of the revered Ramayan Epic. It serves as a disservice to both the source material and the audience, leaving a bitter taste in the mouths of those who had hoped for so much more.

Don't know where to really start from, this is an epic disappointment on all levels. And the fears really came true, the VFX is so poor that, you start to wonder if this is a beta version of a video game launched several years ago, it is that cartoonish and was an eyesore. Acting wise, none really standout, though the aggressive version of Lord Rama played into the strengths of Prabhas, he was just okayish, Kriti had just to smile and weep. Even with a caricaturish characterisation of Ravan, it was Saif who had put some genuine effort among all the cast and crew. Screenplay is so lazy, the dialogues at places are as cringeworthy as hell. Technically, for a 500Cr project, this has to be the biggest scam in Indian Cinema in the recent times, nothing much about cinematography, as the entire movie was shot indoor, editing is pathetic, action choreography was straight out of many Hollywood movies. Only saving grace is the songs of Ajay-Atul and the score of Sachet-Parampara, it really elevates the proceedings.Coming to director Om Raut, for a man who directed two critically and commercially successful ventures like Lokmanya and Tanhaji, he perhaps overestimated himself and probably went overconfident in directing this, some of the creative choices like Ravan and Lanka design might not go well with the staunch followers of Hindusim, his version of creating a commercial Ramanaya is the worst decision.Bottom-line: Wait for Salaar, stay away from this.

Manoj Muntashir what the hell u have made .....?Can't have worst depiction of holy ramayana than this movie
Out of Context and Derogatory dialoguesAdipurush is merely a Bollywood-ised version of one of the most epic tales that ever existed. If you keep the story aside for it's largely known to all, the execution turns out to be a messy blend of over-the-top CGI and passable VFX, and making it worse are the intentionally funny dialogues that sound misplaced in a sensitive and mythological story. Why would you want Hanuman to say 'Jalegi tere baap ki'?""Better to watch the ancient Ramayana rather then wasting time on this so called Epic.

""Bhagwan Hanuman ji will be in need of Sanjivani after watching Adipurush ""See the whole movie is a disaster , there is nothing positive point about it , I don't want to talk about VFX . Directing is also worst . Om Raut had no vision and just copy pasted all the Hollywood scenes in this movie . It is a poor compilation of all the Hollywood action scenes . It is everything , but not Ramayan . But my problem isn't even that , the problem how can you get the most basic history wrong.Problems with getting the story wrong
1) Casting : The first basic mistake . Prabhas looks like Ravan with moustache and aggressiveness . Kriti no where looks like Maa Sita , she looks like Devakanya . Saif looks like a tik toker , who just came out of Saloon . And there is a surprise , Dashrath ji character , you couldn't even see that appearance on TV , leave theatre alone .2) Giant Hanuman speaks with Maa Sita : If you read Hanuman Chalisa "" Sukshma roop dhari Siya hi dhikava "" ~ In a small , gentle form you appear in front of Sita Maa , can't you get that right ?3) Asgard Lanka : Lanka is one of the most beautiful city ever created , why did you darken it , it is made of steel .4) Ravan always cunning : According to scriptures Ravan is one of the most intelligent person , he is an astrologist , he is the knower 4 Vedas and 6 Upanishads . In this movie he was always shown cunning and dumb .5) Vanarsena : could be compared to Early Humans , but here they are shown as monkeys
6) Rama asks Vanarsena to fight for him : Rama never asked or encouraged the Vanarsena to fight for him , he just asked Sugreeva to help him .7) Rama : Lord Rama , calm and composed at all situations , but he is always shown aggresive .8) Hairstyles and Dressing : If you look at them , it feels like some tik tokers were in the movie . Ravan army with some darth vader masks , Ravan with a tik tok hairstyle .And I at least expected some powerful scenes to have an impact . They had no impact . Scenes like Jambvant encouraging Hanuman , Hanuman bringing Sanjeevani , Ram Setu , nothing was powerful , it was so cheap . It could be ignored in OTT as well . Please watch Ram Anand Ramayan , it was so beautiful.Please , if you can't write a basic story on Ramayan don't . We won't accept this , why should you change our history . Leave VFX , at least the casting , or at least the story line wasn't perfect . A 6 years old kid knows the story better than you.

ADIPURUSH for me is absolutely trash movie. Not worth for watch first, the casts are playing as unreal in movie.They don't look kinda real characters.And what to say about dialogue, the used dialogue was totally pathetic 😭 which can't be used for ramayan characters.VFX was what to say, same as before.I don't think they have changed any vfx in this eight months. The ravana Chamgadar is same as before, which i cannot watch 😄 so, unrealistic. The movie budget is not worth to say for this kind of movie.Overall adipurush is a comedy, trashed vfx and down oriented dialogues movie.Watch at your own risk.I am giving 2/10 stars for just a one song which i liked during starting of movie i.e, RAM SIYA RAM .

There should be less than 0 rating for such a bad movie, there is a huge difference between Ramayana and Adipurush movie. This movie has done the work of defaming the history of India and the history of Maryada Purushottam Shri Ram, people are watching the movie only to see Prabhas, otherwise a good movie cannot be made in favor of Hinduism from Bollywood everyone knows. None of the cast and crew of Adipurush would have read Ramayana, this is just the irony of Ramayana, it is a request to all Hindus, please do not watch this movie because through this movie, they want to tell a different history to the new generation.

8,16 June 2023," A Deeply Disappointing Adaptation: Aadipurush
","
Aadipurush, unfortunately, proves to be an immense letdown and a missed opportunity. The film's visual effects appear artificial and excessive, giving the impression that suitable shooting locations were lacking, leading to the decision to film every scene in a studio with green screens and relying heavily on post-processing effects.The casting choices are severely flawed. Hanuman's character, smaller in stature compared to Ram and Ravan, seems out of place. Throughout the film, Ram's character lacks any semblance of emotion, and there is a noticeable absence of charm on his face. Laxman's portrayal fails to do justice to the character, and the Vanar Sena appears to be a combination of monkeys and chimpanzees, indicating a lack of understanding from the director regarding the distinction between Vanars and other animals. Sita's character lacks the pride and grace befitting the traditional portrayal, instead being presented as a modern interpretation. Moreover, Ravan's character is depicted solely as a dark villain, disregarding his status as a knowledgeable Brahmin. These creative decisions substantially distort the story of Ramayan, misrepresenting several key aspects.The dialogue further adds to the film's disgrace. The characters communicate disrespectfully with each other. Prabhas, portraying Ram, addresses Sita by his father-in-law's name (Janki). Hanuman's character is muzzled, hindering proper communication. Most of the dialogue feels as if it were penned by an amateur writer, lacking the depth and knowledge expected from a well-versed writer.Witnessing this disrespect toward the Hindu epic was deeply disheartening. It is astonishing to contemplate how the actors, writers, and filmmakers could transform such a beautiful story into a subpar production. The film's failure is truly disheartening, as it squanders the opportunity to create a remarkable cinematic experience, instead delivering a dispiriting disappointment. The sheer magnitude of this disgrace compelled me to leave the theater before its conclusion.

Worst movie of the year 2023. VFX quality is childish. Acting of protagonists is 🤢. Costume designing is 🤧. Hairstyles are 😭.If you want to watch Ramayana, then go for Ramanand Sagar's RAMAYANA. You can watch it free on YouTube.Look, it's your choice, your money, whether you want to watch the movie on big screen or not.These 🤧 types of VFX and acting skills can be seen in Salman Khan's movies. There is no doubt about that.Mr. Director probably thought that Indian youths are dumb, and imotional to Sri Rama. So, they would sure go and watch the movie.Now, the real question:-Is it worthy to go to theater and watch the movie?Well, my suggestion is a big ""NO"".

10,18 June 2023," Please Refund - They Sold This Movie Using Lord Ram's Name
","
First of all, I want to say something to Prabhas fans. This movie made money not because of Prabhas. This movie made money only because the name of Lord Rama and Lord Hanuman was thrown. The last two movies of Prabhas were super flop. This movie made money only because Hindu religious sentiments were involved and that's why people went to watch it, it's not because of Prabhas.One more reason is that, the makers scammed the audience in trailer, interviews, and various series of incidents before the movie.Before the premier of the movie, the dialogue writer said that, the whole movie is based on Ramayana, the Hindu epic. Now, after the movie is released, him and including others are claiming that it is not based on Ramayana, after they were charged for blasphemy in Delhi High court.Now, when they say that this movie is not based on Ramayana, they are still using these names of Lord Rama, Hanuman, Sita or Jankai, Lankesh or Dashanan or Ravana, Bali, Sugriv, etc. All these names, all these characters, are based on Ramayana. This is the basis that this movie should be banned for blasphemy and hurting religious sentiments of billions of Hindu followers all over the world.Next, they took six more months time to fix the movie. That was indeed not to fix the movie but to plan the methods to trick and deceive the audience so that they buy the tickets.For example, keeping one seat empty for Lord Hanuman in every theatres was a publicity stunt too. They even captured a monkey in Telangana and placed it on theatres to get the attention.Still, after six months, the only thing they changed in the movie was the saturation and brightness. They made brighter scenes darker and dark scenes brighter to hide the details and flaws. The whole movie was dark, couldn't see anything even after using a torch.Talking about details, the cheap 3D models were just downloaded from the internet. I personally checked and found one of monsters shown in the movie, already available on the internet.They downloaded those models and slightly modified them, like the facial expression, so that people won't identify. Thankfully, I caught them doing so and immediately identified those models as I am a game developer myself and I have used one of them in my video game already before they used it the movie.I have the 3d file saved on my computer. It is ditto to the monster shown in Adipurush, just a few facial expressions are changed.This movie is a total scam. They said 600 crores budget, but the actual investment is $0 as those 3D models are already available. I'm angry man. I don't want to write anything more.And, lastly, Prabhas fans, shame on you and shame on your brain and mindset for considering Prabhas sold this movie. This movie was sold in the name of Lord Rama and Lord Hanuman, not that clown Prabhas. The whole movie is clownish and insult to Hinduism.Foreigners who don't know the actual Ramayana will think that this is the real Ramayana. Therefore, Adipursh is an insult to our religion and culture, it should be banned permanently and the people who were scammed should be refunded their money back.

What are these appearances, why do Lankesh has A vampire (bat) as his vehicle when we all know that Sita was captured in Pushpak Vimaan, Why Raghav is wearing leather belts ? Why Shesh always will stand behind Raghav and give negative reviews to him on any situation? Why Bajrang has a 3rd class dialogue delivery with Indrajeet? Why Sugreev , Angad and all did not get the Bajrang like appearances ? Why Indrajeet look like Tattoo artist from South Goa ? Why Ravan's 9 heads are like some book's arranged in a shelf and Why god why ? Why did i watch this movie ? Lord Shri Ram and Hanumanji , please forgive me for watching this movie. Hope Om Raut stops making movies. One smart move that you changed names for all characters and you can later claim its your version of Ramayan and its inspired not remake. Sahi hai.

Prabhas looks absolutely ugly in the movie which is very distracting even if I try to enjoy this movie as a movie for children. Lots of CGI has been used just to make him look young and fit. Ravan and his brothers look younger than Lord Ram which is stupid. These Rakshasas were conquering world even before Lord Ram was born. It seems like our revered God's character was butchered for the sake of a lazy superstar who has accidentally hit on the box office draw.Movie is bad. The vision and the portrayal of characters which we have seen since childhood doesn't fit here. Even though I am all for allowing multiple interpretation, here it doesn't come well.

Adipurush, a much-anticipated film starring Prabhas, Saif Ali Khan, and Kriti Sanon, fails to live up to the expectations of its viewers. Despite a promising premise and a talented cast, the movie falls short in multiple aspects, leaving the audience unsatisfied and disillusioned.One of the major letdowns of Adipurush lies in its character development. Prabhas, known for his charismatic presence on-screen, fails to justify his role as the protagonist. His performance lacks depth and fails to evoke the necessary emotions that could have brought the character to life. Similarly, Saif Ali Khan and Kriti Sanon also struggle to make a lasting impact, as their characters feel underdeveloped and fail to leave a lasting impression.Another glaring issue with Adipurush is its screenplay and dialogue. The film relies heavily on overhyped and low-impact dialogues that do not resonate with the audience. The lack of impactful writing makes it difficult for the viewers to connect with the story or the characters, leading to a sense of detachment throughout the movie.Furthermore, the visual effects in Adipurush, touted as one of its strengths, turn out to be lackluster. The CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery) feels unpolished and fails to seamlessly blend with the live-action sequences. The result is a jarring and unconvincing visual experience that takes away from the overall immersion in the film.The filmmakers had the opportunity to elevate Adipurush by focusing on simplicity and utilizing a more accessible language. However, they missed the mark by overcomplicating the narrative and using convoluted storytelling techniques. As a result, the movie becomes unnecessarily convoluted and difficult to follow, leaving the audience feeling disconnected and perplexed.In conclusion, Adipurush is a disappointing film that fails to capitalize on its potential. The lackluster character development, underwhelming performances, weak dialogue, and unimpressive visual effects contribute to its downfall. While it had the ingredients for success, the execution falls short, resulting in a wasted opportunity. Ultimately, this movie fails to leave a lasting impact and will likely leave viewers feeling unsatisfied and unfulfilled.

Adipurush, despite generating immense anticipation, fails to meet the expectations set for it. Marketed as a grand spectacle, the film disappoints on various fronts. The CGI work, which was supposed to be extravagant, turns out to be subpar, lacking the finesse and attention to detail that one would expect from a high-budget production. The underwhelming visual effects further contribute to the film's lackluster presentation, leaving viewers disengaged and unimpressed with the story.The sentiments of many Hindus were hurt by this film. Adipurush takes liberties with the revered story of Ramayana, altering its narrative, characterization, language, and even resorting to poorly written dialogues. This creative license comes at the cost of the film's integrity and disrespects the source material, leaving a bitter taste for those familiar with the original tale. It is disheartening to witness Bollywood continue to disregard Hindu sentiments for the sake of entertainment.Ultimately, Adipurush emerges as a highly disappointing and controversial adaptation, leaving audiences yearning for a more respectful and faithful retelling of the epic.

What a poorly made movie. Vfx is more like a videogame from the 2010's, and every scene looks fake. Charecter arcs are missing completely and hence charecters dont make sense at all in their mannerisms. Choice of actors is veyry poor - prabhas is miscast, superficial and wodden . He has outdone his cardboard acting from Radhe Shyam, saif as ravana tried hard and has great screen presence but also ravan + lanka = straight out of game of thrones + vikings + punk rock band. Hanumans dialogues - street style. Cinematic liberties = too many. The movie is a disgrace of indias most loved epic - Ramayana. Avoid at all costs.

600cr??????Not even of 600Rs.They intentionally showed lord Ram like very loser person.Even they did mockery of lord Hanuman.Laxman character was like unnecessary he didn't did anything in the movie.even lord Hanuman is always giving funny expressions like this actor don't know the acting.Maybe they tried to destroy prabhas's career and prabhas didn't even get it.there is not a single detailing in the movie
About ramayana. They just showed just like we tell about ramayana to any person like "" there was one Ram, one Sita,one Laxman,one Hanuman and one ravan and Ram kills the ravan that's it. As like this..

I recently had the opportunity to watch Adipurush, a movie supposedly based on the Hindu mythology Ramayan. I wanted to take a moment to share my feedback and express my disappointment with the overall execution of the film.Firstly, I must mention that the departure from the traditional portrayal of characters in Adipurush was quite disheartening. Ravan, a revered character known for his devotion to Lord Shiva and his strict vegetarianism, was portrayed in a manner that completely disregarded these important aspects. This not only deviated from the original mythology but also had the potential to hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus who hold the Ramayan Epic in high regard.Moving on to the visual effects (VFX), it was quite evident that the film fell short in this aspect. Despite having a higher budget than Brahmastra, the VFX in Adipurush failed to impress. It seemed as though more attention was given to superficial color grading rather than focusing on achieving high-quality visual effects that would enhance the overall viewing experience.Additionally, the dialogues in the film were quite disappointing. While attempting to present a more modern interpretation, it felt like the important characters like Raavan and Hanuman were more like goons living in slum areas.In summary, Adipurush proved to be a disastrous departure from tradition. The film's misguided choices in character portrayal, subpar visual effects, and abysmal dialogues made it an underwhelming cinematic experience. It failed to deliver on its promise of an engaging and respectful adaptation of the revered Ramayan Epic. As an audience member, my disappointment was profound, and it truly affected my overall impression of the film.I hope that Adipurush team takes all these negative feedback into consideration for future projects. I believe that with the right attention to detail and a sincere commitment to honoring the source material, it is possible to create adaptations that resonate with audiences and do justice to the rich mythology they are based on.

Really this is how they created Ramayana in 700 crore budget. Utterly disappointed. Even the Ramananda Sagar's Ramayana which was aired more than 35 years ago is 100 times better than this without any VFX. Not a single good moment this movie. Even changed the Name like Ram as ragav, Sita as Janaki, Laxman as Shesh, Hanuman as Bajrang and so on. Vision less direction, cheap dialogues, irrelevant costumes, chapri makeup of ravan. He was looking like a tik tok chapri. This movie is full of disappointment and full of mistakes. All movie was dark looks like all scenes are from night. I will recommend not to waste your money on this.

25,18 June 2023," Adipurush: A Disappointing and Misguided Interpretation
","
Director Om Raut's highly anticipated film ""Adipurush"" promised to be a grand retelling of the epic Ramayan with a star-studded cast including Prabhas, Kriti Sanon, Saif Ali Khan, and Devdutta Nage. However, upon watching the film, it becomes evident that it falls far short of expectations and fails to deliver a satisfying cinematic experience.One of the most glaring issues with ""Adipurush"" is its visual presentation. Despite being a live-action film, it often feels like a poorly executed animated movie. The special effects and CGI work are subpar, resulting in unrealistic and unconvincing visual sequences. This lackluster visual quality is particularly disappointing considering the film's large budget and the potential for stunning visuals within the context of the Ramayan.Another significant flaw lies in how the film handles the sacred story of the Ramayan. ""Adipurush"" takes unnecessary liberties with the source material, deviating from the essence and integrity of the epic. The film's screenplay and characterizations fail to capture the depth and complexity of the original tale, resulting in a shallow and superficial interpretation. The narrative lacks the emotional resonance and spiritual depth that make the Ramayan such a timeless and revered story.Furthermore, the performances of the lead actors, despite their talent, fail to make a lasting impression. Prabhas, known for his charismatic presence, feels miscast as Lord Ram, lacking the gravitas and spiritual aura that the character demands. Kriti Sanon's portrayal of Sita lacks depth and fails to capture the strength and resilience of the iconic character. Saif Ali Khan's performance as Ravana, though initially promising, falls victim to weak writing and fails to elevate the character beyond a one-dimensional villain.The pacing of ""Adipurush"" is uneven, with certain scenes dragging on for too long while others feel rushed and underdeveloped. The lack of cohesive storytelling and the absence of emotional resonance make it difficult to stay engaged throughout the film's runtime.In conclusion, ""Adipurush"" is a disappointing cinematic experience that fails to do justice to the epic Ramayan. The film's subpar visual effects, misguided interpretation of the source material, and lackluster performances contribute to its overall lack of impact. Fans of the Ramayan and those expecting a grand and faithful adaptation will find themselves sorely let down by this underwhelming rendition.

""ADIPURUSH"" is an unfortunate attempt at adapting an epic story, resulting in a cinematic disaster that falls flat on multiple levels. From the onset, it becomes painfully evident that the film has made some regrettable choices in terms of visual effects (VFX), dialogues, and the overall adaptation.Let's start with the VFX, or rather, the lack thereof. The movie's visual effects are nothing short of abysmal. The poorly rendered creatures and unconvincing movement leave the audience cringing with disappointment.Moving on to the dialogues, they prove to be equally disappointing. The use of cheap language, lacking depth and originality. The dialogues fail to evoke any emotional response.However, the most egregious offense committed by ""ADIPURUSH"" is its degrading adaptation of an epic. The film takes the rich source material and reduces it to a shallow and misguided narrative. The characters are poorly developed, their motivations are unclear, and the plot meanders aimlessly, losing the essence of the original story. It's disheartening to witness such a disregard for the source material, as it alienates fans who were eagerly anticipating a faithful and respectful interpretation.Overall, ""ADIPURUSH"" is a disappointing cinematic experience that fails on multiple fronts. Its woeful VFX, cringe-worthy dialogues, and degrading adaptation make it a forgettable and regrettable addition to the genre. Save yourself the trouble and seek out better cinematic offerings that do justice to the stories they aim to tell.

Ramayan is an epic close to heart for billions of people. It is a sacred religious text which people worship. There had been seveal series, movies, animation based on Ramayan in the past, but no one tried to malign its dignity.This new and flop director copied the sequences from several hollywood movies and mix it with Ramayan which is very inappropriate. The costumes, dialogues, VFX, respect for each other , portrayed in a very wrong way which is certainly not Ramayan. Dont watch it, instead go to other versions.VFX is poor than what used to have in 1980s. The film is only riding on money paid to media.

This movie is one of the worst I have ever seen. It bears no resemblance to Ramayana. I strongly advise people to listen to or read Valmiki Ramayan, which has no connection whatsoever to this film. If you have any doubts about my credibility, I recommend listening to Changnti Koteshwar Rao ji's explanation of Valmiki Ramayan.Most of the important facts from the Valmiki Ramayan were missed or inaccurately interpreted in this movie.For example:
Lord Ram doesn't know that Ravana abducted Sita mata until he meets Sugriva and Hanuman.Lanka, which was built by Viswakarma for Ravana's step-brother Khubera, should be depicted as a beautiful place.The fight between Sugriva and Vali occurs twice, and it is in the second attempt that Rama kills Vali, as Vali and Sugriva are twin brothers, Rama finds it difficult to identify Vali.Hanuman recites Ramayan in ashok vatika to establish a dialogue with Sita Mata before revealing himself as Rama's messenger, in order to gain her trust, as he is not a person appointed by Ravana.The list of inaccuracies goes on. From a technical perspective, the visual effects are extremely poor, and the screenplay is mediocre and sloppy.#selfrespect #ramayana #thisisnotramayan.

The storyline was illogical, the dialogues were cheesy, the vfx were laughable, the flow of the movie was choppy, the acting was wooden and the dark environments were depressing. It was a mockery of the audience's faith and intelligence. I would rather watch Salman Khan classics like Race 3 or Tubelight than this garbage. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.

I strongly advise against subjecting yourself to this particular movie based on the Ramayana. It is an extremely disappointing and poorly executed film that fails to capture the essence and beauty of the original epic. Throughout the movie, you will find that the scenes lack depth and fail to engage the viewer, the dialogues are uninspiring and lack meaningful impact, and the characters are poorly developed, lacking the depth and complexity that make them so beloved in the Ramayana.What is truly disheartening is the apparent disregard for Hindu sentiments exhibited by this film. It seems as though the creators intentionally sought to hurt and offend the religious and cultural sensibilities of the Hindu community. This blatant disrespect is not only insensitive but also demonstrates a lack of understanding and appreciation for the significance of the Ramayana as a cherished cultural and religious text.Given the numerous flaws and the offensive nature of this movie, it is my strong belief that it should be banned. It is an utter waste of both time and money, providing no redeeming qualities or entertainment value. I cannot stress enough that this film does not deserve even a single star rating. Spare yourself the disappointment and seek out better adaptations that do justice to the beauty and essence of the Ramayana.

I watched it and found no resemblance from the old Sanskrit epic. Also, the choice of language, costumes and visual has a big disconnect from what Bharat is familiar with.The movie features a Lanka made of nothing but black color. Lanka was supposed to be beautiful and made of gold.The pushpak viman is literally a giant bat and not a airship/aircraft.God Hanuman is very wise and witty, and the dialogues in this movie are not even worthy of the streets. He was supposed to be small when meeting Ma Sita, with his hands folded. But this movies shows a giant Hanuman with his first on the chest.VFX is so bad, it looks ki an intro to a demo version of a video game. The entire movie is so dark, it's difficult to make sense of the visuals. The characters are not clearly visible during fights.

As an avid moviegoer and fan of mythology, I had high hopes for ""Adipurush."" However, this cinematic adaptation of a revered Hindu epic turned out to be an utter disappointment. From the moment the opening credits rolled, it became painfully evident that this film failed to do justice to the source material.One of the major flaws of ""Adipurush"" lies in its shallow storytelling. Instead of delving into the rich complexities of the Ramayana, the filmmakers chose to rely on flashy visuals and mindless action sequences. The depth and emotional resonance of the original story were sacrificed for the sake of spectacle, leaving the audience disconnected from the characters and their motivations.

The CGI feels outdated and tacky, making the mythical creatures and battle sequences appear more comical than awe-inspiring. It's hard to believe that a film made in this era could look so cheap and unconvincing.The lead actors deliver forgettable performances that lack depth and charisma.

The movie doesn't even deserve 1 star. Only Prabhas' fans are giving it higher ratings. If you don't believe it is a money grab, just read what Manoj Muntasir said:In an interview with AajTak, Manoj said that the film was heavily inspired by Ramayana. He said in Hindi, ""The name of the film is Adipurush. Let me be clear about two things, we have not made Ramayana, we were only inspired by it. Even if you see our disclaimer, we were very clear about it. It would have been easy for us to name the film Ramayana, keeping in mind the marketing strategies. But we knew from the beginning that we are only heavily inspired by the Ramayana, but we are not making Ramayana. We just made a small chunk of the battle fought in the Ramayana.""Now, coming to the story, it has a lot of missing characters who play a really important part in the actual story. And most of the characters which are included don't actually play any significant role in this ""kalyug's version"".Lanka is depicted as a coal mine, even KGF was better than this Lanka which is supposed to be made of gold, hence the phrase, ""sone ki Lanka"".Dialogues are cringe/utter garbage, actors have no facial expressions/emotions in most of the scenes. I won't go into many details, as I think most of the reviews on social media already cover how bad the dialogues are.Don't waste time and money going to theaters. And if you are planning to take your kids thinking that they will ""learn something about our culture/history"" you are wrong. You are better off showing them ""Ramayana: The Legend of Prince Rama"".

Anyway it was just my opinion and makers and so called ""stars"" don't even care to read it, they'll continue with their work but whoever reads this please 🙏🏻 read the Ramayan before watching this movie. Audience should not remember this on screen Ramayan, I guarantee you you will be mesmerized after you read it. The characters you will imagine after reading the Ramayan, none of the actor from this movie can live up to your imagination. Ramayan is NOT A MYTH (MYTHOLOGY), IT IS OUR HISTORY.JAI SRI RAM 🙏🏻

Adipurush review :Lord Ram in a perennial angry mode;
Sita Mata lacking purity and innocence;
Lord Hanuman indulging in Bombaiyya slang;
The mighty Raavan without a crown or throne hammering away like an iron-smith in one scene;
A bare chested Indrajeet with a tattoed body appearing a criss cross between Marvel's Quicksilver and DC's Flash.Guys, is this a joke?Is it a spoof?Is it even a film?Whatever it is, Adipurush is NOT Ramayana. It just can't be.Making a blatant mockery of the great religious epic, this film showcases the worst side of today's Bollywood, which has become creatively bankrupt in recent times.I had loved Om Raut's Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior (2020) and naturally, was eagerly awaiting his interpretation of Ramayan. But Adipurush was a painful watch. It truly saddens and pains you to view the substandard execution on all aspects from VFX to dialogues to those jarring animated demons jumping on your face in 3D. The dark colour pallette given to the supposedly glittering 'Sone Ki Lanka' makes you wonder if this Raavan is inhabiting some other universe here. Asgard, probably!!The only saving grace (if you can call it that) is Ajay Atul's scintillating score with 'Jai Shri Ram' chants elevating the proceedings to a reasonable extent.Prabhas, a brilliant actor no doubt, reprises his Bahubali act while playing Lord Ram. The serene and calm composure associated with the God is missing. Not his fault, the script offers no scope. Kriti Sanon is beautiful but lacks the purity and sanctity of Mata Sita. You can say Saif has performed well if his character was Alauddin Khilji and not Raavan. Devdatta Nage, another fantastic actor, is made to play Lord Hanuman mouthing lines like 'Tere baap ki..'. Oh please!! Sunny Singh is turned in to an extra as Laxman. And pray, what was the need to show Vibhishan's wife (Trupti Toradmal) with all that cleavage sheavage? Who even thought of this scene, man!!I can go on ranting but honestly, that will be an exercise in futility. Bollywood ka 'funda' is crystal clear, nowadays. Just rake in the moolah within the first weekend and then sell the movie on OTT to garner the profits and move on. Creativity or aesthetics be damned!!Adipurush may become a box office hit if I go by the 'Housefull' crowd at Citylight Cinema, Matunga where I saw it last evening. But does that really matter?!! Ramanand Sagar's TV series Ramayan (1987) is still remembered and revered after three decades. Adipurush will be forgotten by next friday. Or is it already??!!!Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni.

Total failure by the creators in attempting to recreate a classic. The final product seems just to be a mere money grabbing scheme which preys on people's sentiments.Everyone in the country knows the story and only the execution would set it apart. This attempt does neither justice to the story nor to the execution. Total lack of conviction. No effort put in on even very basic details which even a 5 year old in our country is so well versed.Can't believe the tapori dialogues given to our revered dieties. These are the kind of film making that gives bad name to Bollywood. They will definitely make a lot of money unfortunately which will encourage other money grabbers of Bollywood to rise and conjure something similar.

","
Adipurush is a 2023 Indian epic action film that had the potential to be a great adaptation of the Hindu epic Ramayana. However, the film is ultimately a disappointment, thanks to its slow pacing, uneven tone, and lack of emotional depth.The film's performances are all solid, with Prabhas giving a good performance as Rama and Saif Ali Khan giving a more nuanced performance as Ravana. However, the film's supporting cast is largely underutilized, and the film's action sequences are not as exciting as they could have been.The film's biggest problem is its pacing. The first half of the film is slow and ponderous, and the film's tone is uneven, veering between serious and comedic. This makes it difficult to get invested in the story or the characters.The film also lacks emotional depth. The film's battle scenes are exciting, but they lack the emotional impact that they could have had. The film's love story between Rama and Sita is also underdeveloped.Overall, Adipurush is a missed opportunity. The film had the potential to be a great adaptation of the Ramayana, but it is ultimately a disappointment.

This movie revolves around Ramayan which is completely contra to the real Ramayan, the funny part is that Saif Ali Khan depicted as Ravan was in a modern hair cut which is totally illogical to me.If I'm watching a historical movie which has enough proofs I would like to watch it exactly how it is.Its better directors producers dont make such movies if they can even read Ramayan once,
I think if they have referred the Ramayan the movie would be produced better.Prabhas acting was laughable, though he have good personality but when someone is depicting character of Lord Shri Ram , he can not be look like him.I think Prabhas could not make a difference between Bahubali and Adipurush his expression remained the same all time.Such movies should be banned not only they hurt religious sentiments but also waste peoples time & money.Hope this review would be helpful

The hype about the movie got us to book tickets well in advance at out favorite top row middle recliners.This movie had high hopes riding on its picturization, as we have seen this epic too many times before. It was a surprise to see the entire introduction scenes to be fast forwarded directly to Vanvaas phase. The Vardan grated to Ravan in the opening scene is debatable as it is never heard of before. The Lanka which is known to be Kubers erstwhile kingdom, to be of gold. The Lanka shown here, despite freehand at vfx is oddly black in colour. The casting could be better as charector to cast is starkly juxtaposed. This epic could spread over different series of movies. Every charector has a story and connection to another. Ram, Seeta, Hanuman, Ravan, the war etc. Could have come in phases and created a massive franchise.

59,18 June 2023," Parody of the epic Ramayana
","
The movie Adipurush, a parody of the epic Ramayana, attempts to incorporate its own imaginative elements inspired by Hollywood movies. However, this attempt has backfired, resulting in a disastrous outcome. The Ramayana is not merely a story from Hindu mythology, but a guide for individuals on how to live a good and respectful life. These teachings have been passed down through generations by our parents and grandparents.The epic emphasizes the importance of responsibilities, with the husband being the head of the household and the wife managing the home. It also emphasizes the significance of young people following and respecting their elders. On the other side of the story, Ravana, the king of Lanka, is portrayed as a character who is not a demon but rather overconfident and possesses excessive self-respect. This overconfidence stems from his victories and his devotion to the gods. However, it leads him to become excessively greedy, believing he can do whatever he desires, including capturing and imprisoning women.Ravana's character teaches us the dangers of becoming overconfident in our own success, as it can ultimately lead to a downfall from a high position to a low one. The movie also introduces creative elements such as Ravana forcefully stealing the sky chariot, Pushpaka Viman, from Kubera, which transforms into a demonic bat. However, these additions seem to be attempts to inject Hollywood-inspired imagination into the minds of the audience, but they are received poorly and result in a disaster.I strongly object to this narrative of the great epic Ramayana being turned into a parody. The movie Adipurush fails to capture the essence of the original story and instead presents a distorted version that deviates from the valuable lessons and teachings it imparts.

60,18 June 2023," A Disastrous Departure from Tradition,total garbage.
","
Adipurush, a highly anticipated movie purportedly based on the Hindu epic Ramayan, falls woefully short of expectations, leaving audiences disappointed and disillusioned. From its misguided choices in visual effects to abysmal dialogues and language inconsistencies, the film misses the mark on multiple levels, resulting in a cinematic experience that can only be described as total garbage.Visual Effects: A Spectacle Gone Wrong
One of the most glaring issues with Adipurush lies in its misguided choices regarding visual effects. Instead of enhancing the storytelling and immersing the viewers in a mythical world, the film's visual effects appear cheap and unconvincing. The lack of attention to detail is evident, as the CGI often looks artificial and fails to create a sense of awe or wonder. This lackluster approach robs the film of its potential to transport audiences into the enchanting realm of Ramayan, leaving them disconnected and unengaged.Abysmal Dialogues: Failing to Inspire
Another major letdown of Adipurush is its woefully written dialogues. The exchanges between characters lack depth, substance, and emotional resonance, reducing pivotal moments in the story to mere shallow interactions. The film fails to capture the essence of the original mythology's profound philosophical and moral teachings, opting instead for trite and uninspiring lines that fail to leave a lasting impact. This absence of compelling dialogue hampers character development and overall narrative progression, leaving the audience yearning for more substance and authenticity.Language Inconsistencies: A Disrespectful Dissonance
Adipurush further compounds its flaws by disregarding the importance of language consistency. In the Hindu epic Ramayan, the characters' manner of speech reflects their personalities, social backgrounds, and cultural contexts. However, in this film, the language inconsistencies are glaring and disrespectful to the source material. Characters who are traditionally depicted as refined and eloquent suddenly resort to colloquialisms and slang, diluting the cultural authenticity and diminishing the impact of their roles. This departure from tradition not only compromises the film's integrity but also demonstrates a lack of respect for the original mythology and has the potential to hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus.Character Transformations: An Appalling Disregard
One of the most distressing aspects of Adipurush is its blatant disregard for retaining the original character personalities. The film drastically transforms Ravan, a Brahmin devotee of Shiv, who is known for his vegetarianism and adherence to strict moral codes. In this adaptation, Ravan's character is completely distorted, betraying the fundamental essence of the mythology. Such an irresponsible portrayal not only disrespects the core values of Hinduism but also undermines the rich cultural heritage that the Ramayan embodies. This departure from tradition leaves audiences questioning the intentions and motivations of the film's creators, who have chosen to deviate from a well-established narrative without valid reason or justification.Conclusion:
Adipurush, touted as a cinematic masterpiece based on the revered Hindu epic Ramayan, disappoints on multiple levels. Its misguided choices in visual effects, abysmal dialogues, language inconsistencies, and appalling character transformations showcase a lack of understanding, respect, and reverence for the source material. This departure from tradition not only robs the film of its potential to enchant and inspire audiences but also has the potential to hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus. Adipurush, in its current form, is an unfortunate example of a promising concept gone horribly wrong, leaving viewers yearning for a faithful and authentic adaptation that pays homage to the timeless and cherished mythology of Ramayan.

I knew Bollywood has lost its roots but now it's proved they know nothing about film making anymore. What a waste of a movie this is with absolute absurd portrayal of characters in the worst possible manner. It looks more like a Mughal Empire storyline than Ramayan. The characters were far from what Ramayan is all about and they claim to have spent close to $100 million on this piece of junk? I'd happily prefer to the original Ramayan from the 1990s that has authenticity and meaning to it. The lead character of this movie looked more like an action hero than Lord Rama. Typical Bollywood masala movie and the worst ever portrayal of Ramayan. The makers and the cast should be ashamed of this creation.

I wish I could rate this movie as zero or negative. All those who have watched any other movie based on Ramayana or even Ram Leela will keep on thinking that what's going on in Adipurush, some point kept on bothering me while watching the movie are:
*What kind of language they are using.*Characterization of Shree Ram is totally wrong, they have shown Shree Ram in angry mood & sometime showing off, which is totally wrong bcs we call him Adipurush just bcs of his calmness in every situation, but in this movie you will see Lakshman(incarnation of Shesh naag in cool mood)
& Shree Ram(Incarnation of Lord Vishnu in angry mood)
*Don't know why Shree Ram keeps adressing Lakshman as shesh
*Everyone is wearing leather clothes & footwear
*Hairstyle & look of the character is falsely depicted
*& obviously vfx doesn't feel like worth 600cr, one can create in the budget of 1k.*I dare you to find the gold in the city of gold lanka
*Last but not least the poor(tapori) language they have used in this movie.I don't recommend this at all. Rest you watch the movie & find it yourself, melody khao khud jaan jao.

65,16 June 2023," Disappointing and Overhyped: Adipurush Falls Flat
","
As an avid moviegoer, I had high hopes for Adipurush, especially with all the buzz surrounding its release. However, after watching it, I can't help but feel utterly let down. Adipurush is a prime example of a film that fails to live up to its enormous hype, and it falls flat in nearly every aspect.First and foremost, the screenplay is an absolute mess. The story lacks coherence and fails to engage the audience from the beginning. The pacing is all over the place, making it difficult to connect with the characters or understand their motivations. It feels like the scriptwriters were more interested in creating visually stunning scenes rather than crafting a compelling narrative.The performances in Adipurush are equally underwhelming. The lead actors deliver lackluster performances, failing to bring depth or emotional resonance to their characters. Their dialogue delivery feels forced and unnatural, making it challenging to empathize with them or invest in their journey. Even seasoned actors seem lost in their roles, unable to salvage the poorly written and developed characters.Another major letdown is the film's visual effects. Considering the massive budget allocated to Adipurush, one would expect cutting-edge special effects and breathtaking action sequences. However, what we get is a subpar display of CGI that looks artificial and unconvincing. The battle scenes lack intensity and fail to generate any excitement or thrill. It's a missed opportunity to create awe-inspiring visuals that could have elevated the movie.Furthermore, the direction and editing leave much to be desired. The director seems unsure of the tone and style of the film, resulting in a disjointed and inconsistent experience. Transitions between scenes are jarring, and the overall flow of the movie feels disjointed and confusing. It's as if the filmmakers were more concerned with style over substance, neglecting the basic principles of storytelling.Ultimately, Adipurush falls short of its lofty expectations. With a weak screenplay, uninspired performances, lackluster visual effects, questionable direction, and forgettable music, it fails to deliver on any front. It's a disappointment for fans who were eagerly awaiting a grand cinematic experience. Save your time and money and opt for other, more deserving films instead.

On it, it's clear it was only a gimmick to fool people and they haven't spent a single rupee, to buy sometime for backlash to cool down and media puppets to salvage something. Ramayana is not about action only, where is devotion ,the soul is completely lacking in this film. Ravan looks like character out of Lord of the ring movies. Kriti sanon can't act , Lord hanuman u made into a joker, inderjeet is Jason Momoa aka Aquaman/quicksilver/flash.very disappointed and angry at this mockery and I say it's deliberately done to our greatest epic and history. Makers should be prosecuted and jailed and I hope Prabhas career is finished now. 😠😠😠

After China made corona virus from Bats, OM Raut introduced another virus from a Bat in the movie, what a blunder in the name of creativity. There is a lot to discuss about this attempt to alter the story. It was pathetic to see how Lord Hanuman was shown in the movie. Dialogues were written by some chapri Yutuber. It was a big insult to see Lord Hanuman was given those chapri Dialogues. Pathetic experience. Ravan was glorified in a way, his lannka was of coal rather than of gold, no natural places were shown, introduction scene of Lord Ram was poorer than the graphics of video games which use to come in early 2000. Movie was to dark to digest, Prabas reminded bahubali and saif reminded Tanaji.

He taught us saying sorry doesn't make you small and the one who corrects mistakes is bigger human being. Om Raut goes against every single teaching. After the disastrous teaser he was so full of himself he thought people are trolling just for the sake. So he sat on the material, thought public is idiot and changed the DI color in these 5 months. Made rounds of film festivals. Changed posters and gave us this excretory product in the name of Ramayana.I am against boycott and i am against suppression of art but this is a sin of highest order. OMG the dialogues had me laughing out loud it was so bad. Even my parents who aren't picky about anything devotional were angry at me and then we laughed all the way back from theatre.The bg score is amazing but even if you close your eyes to just hear music you can still hear the dialogues 😭.

Nothing spiritual .More focus is on Ravan who eats most of the screen time rather than on other characters.Most of the movie is in dark.

Director and movie writer must apologise to the viewers for disrespecting the sentiments and using vulgar and disgrace words and dialogues.Not recommended.This is a cartoon show with nothing near to the actual story of lord Rama.Mr. Raut struggles to find a balance and consistency between the epic story and its superhero-verse execution. The dialogue lack the impact that epic heroes of this stature are expected to deliver. Characters sound unconvincing as they randomly oscillate between Adharma ka vidhvansa, to, tere baap ki jalegi and tu marega. The narration feels bland in the first half. It does not evoke the kind of emotional gravity that you would expect from an epic tale like Ramayana. You don't feel invested in the characters enough.The VFX and visual appeal are passable if not impressive. The 3D feels like an unnecessary accessory.Summary: Disgusting and pathetic.

From poorly rendered visual effects to lackluster performances by the lead actors, the film fails to do justice to the grandeur and depth of the original story.The CGI work in the film is of subpar quality, making it hard to suspend disbelief and immerse oneself in the world of the epic. The use of green screens is painfully obvious, resulting in unnatural and unconvincing environments. From poorly animated creatures to amateurish battle sequences, the VFX detracts from the overall experience, leaving viewers more distracted than engaged.In conclusion ""Adipurush"" is a disappointment on multiple levels. Its lackluster visual effects, poor performances, and shallow storytelling overshadow any attempts at reimagining the epic Hindu mythology.

First of all, the way Saif Ali Khan walked in the movie while portraying Raavan made him look like one suffering from constipation. Raavan's 10 heads were literally looking like a double-decker bus. He was seriously having a massage with anacondas!Now I have learnt while growing up that Raavan travelled using the Pushpak Vimaan, but this movie opened my eyes and I got to know that it was a Dragon/Bat.I have also learnt that Raavan had a Lanka made up of Gold, but this movie revealed the untold secret that it was made up of coal, and I guess that is why Hanuman Ji was able to burn it down so easily.Coming on to Meghnad/Indrajeet. He was literally a total cheap copy of Quick Silver. Like from when did Indrajeet have sprinting powers?! And on top of that, he had tattoos all over his body. DUDE!Hanuman Ji's cheap dialogues such as ""Aag tere baap ki, kapda tere baap ka, tel tere baap ka, jalegi bhi teri baap ki"" etc. Etc. Made him look like a clown in the film.Prabhas put a very bad impression on his career after this movie, as his acting was MY GOD. He literally had NO expressions on his face throughout the whole movie.

It is used by our politicians and I don't blame makers of this film that even they were trying to do the same thing but at the same time Religion is something which if not respected then it can backfire and can give extreme hatred. Exactly what is happening with makers of Adipurush.

The characters in Adipurush fail to do justice to the actual personalities of the holy figures they represent, leaving audiences feeling disconnected and disappointed.One of the significant disappointments in Adipurush is the portrayal of Hanumanji. A character known for his charisma and wisdom, Hanumanji's portrayal lacks the captivating presence that is expected of him. The dialogues given to this iconic character are wasted, failing to convey the depth and essence of Hanumanji's wisdom and devotion. This missed opportunity to bring out the true charisma of Hanumanji is a major letdown for fans.Another drawback of Adipurush lies in its language. The movie suffers from a lack of clarity in its dialogue delivery, with an excessive use of modern slangs that seem out of place in the ancient setting. This modernization of language undermines the authenticity of the film and creates a jarring contrast between the setting and the dialogue. It would have been more appropriate to use language that resonates with the historical period being depicted.Moreover, the characters of Ram and Ravan, central figures in the epic tale, are portrayed in a manner that deviates significantly from their well-known personalities. The film fails to capture the essence of these characters, resulting in a lack of emotional connection between the audience and the protagonists. The portrayal of Ram and Ravan lacks the complexity and depth that make them such compelling figures in mythology.Furthermore, Adipurush fails to evoke the feeling of a kingdom for either Ram or Ravan. The grandeur and magnificence that are synonymous with these characters' reigns are missing, leaving the audience without a true sense of the power and glory that they once possessed. The lack of attention to this crucial aspect detracts from the overall immersive experience of the film.One of the most disappointing aspects of Adipurush is its excessive reliance on Western animation and models. Rather than creating a unique visual style that pays homage to the source material, the movie feels like a sluggish copy of some cheap Hollywood production. This over-adaptation of Western influences diminishes the originality and distinctiveness that could have been achieved, resulting in a lackluster cinematic experience.In conclusion, Adipurush fails to live up to the expectations set by its source material. The movie's departure from the way life has been portrayed in sacred texts and books is a major letdown, leaving fans feeling disconnected. The characters in the film, including Hanumanji, lack the charisma and depth that they should possess, and the use of modern slangs in the dialogue further undermines the film's authenticity. Additionally, the portrayal of Ram and Ravan is inconsistent with their true personalities, and the film fails to evoke the grandeur and kingdom associated with these figures. The excessive adaptation of Western animation and models only adds to the disappointment, making Adipurush feel like a lackluster imitation of a cheap Hollywood movie. Overall, Adipurush falls short in its execution and fails to deliver a captivating cinematic experience.

It felt unnecessary and disrespectful, as it deviated from the authentic essence of our religion and its beliefs. It is disheartening to see our sacred stories presented in a sensationalized and misinterpreted manner, which can perpetuate misunderstandings and hurt sentiments.I believe the movie missed an opportunity to explore the profound teachings and values of our religion. Instead, it seemed to prioritize shock value and cheap thrills, detracting from the meaningful messages that could have been conveyed.I hope that future films will take a more thoughtful approach when representing religious narratives and foster greater understanding and respect. As an audience, we deserve narratives that genuinely reflect the depth and significance of our beliefs.

Well, After watching so many reviews already I don't think I have got anything different to say about the movie than what you seen already seen in all those reviews.Now what my problem with this movie is how much effort would it have taken for Om Raut to read the Ramayan or atleast watch it once. Yugo Sako before before making his animated version went through 10 different versions of Ramayan to understand it better. This completely explains that Om Raut's and entire production team only had one aim behind making this movie.... Paisa hi Paisa hoga.I mean decades before respected Ramanand Sagar created such a beautiful depiction of one of the most epic saga in the Indian history and Yugo Sako contributed his entire life spreading the knowledge of this legendary literature. And then Om Raut goes ahead and contribute to their Legacy with this ... I don't know which word will do justice to whatever in the hell he has made.It really makes me shameful of being an Indian that People of other country than my own have higher respect and better undertanding of the sentimental elements and teachings of The Ramayan and our own people tend to make this mockery of it.When Yugo Sako proposed to release his depicition of Ramayan in India, Vishwa Hindu Parishad forbade him to do so and claimed it as a historical legacy of India not to be interfered by an outsider. Well, Tumne Konse Jhande gaad liye ise apne paas rakhke. This movie is a complete disgrace on his and Ramanand Sagar's Legacy and should not be shown to the future generation so as not to have their opinion on Ramayan to be misled in wrong direction. If you have shown this movie to your chidren as their first version of Ramayan, then they are in some serious need of purification as soon as possible. Show them the original depicition, so that they can catch up on the learning of life that Ramayan is supposed to give to them.PS: Don't take me as some sort of holy or kattar Hindu guy who is very intense for the protection of Hinduism. It's just I can't withstand the disrespect of any form of Great creation whose purpose is to spread the teachings of life let it be of any religion or origin.

One of the horrible experience you could ever experience. Almost, from the starting to every scene I was like, ###@$ . I have to say #Farhadsamji's dialog makes more impact on his characters, because his characters are like that , brainless. But, seriously you have so strong characters and persona, and you have given such cheesy and flat dialogs. VFX apart, since ther is no point of talking on it, because we know filmmakers were just joking with us with 600cr plus project. Castings, my goodness!!! Raghava was looking more bahubali, janaki was good in some aspects but felt more like BALAJI tele soap Bahu, with all touch ups. Ravan seemed like a big fan PUSHPA, AND #@$@ with that ravan's head. SUCH a POOR direction that even THOUGH they claim its an adaptation of original RAMAYAN, sorry could connect with the product. If the fan thinks raking crores in opening weekend is success, but doesn't mean the movie is good. Instead , demand for the quality from your star rather than creating account just to increase the imbd rating.

See the whole movie is a disaster , there is nothing positive point about it , I don't want to talk about VFX . Directing is also worst . Om Raut had no vision and just copy pasted all the Hollywood scenes in this movie . It is a poor compilation of all the Hollywood action scenes . It is everything , but not Ramayan . But my problem isn't even that , the problem how can you get the most basic history wrong.Problems with getting the story wrong 1) Casting : The first basic mistake . Prabhas looks like Ravan with moustache and aggressiveness . Kriti no where looks like Maa Sita , she looks like Devakanya . Saif looks like a tik toker , who just came out of Saloon . And there is a surprise , Dashrath ji character , you couldn't even see that appearance on TV , leave theatre alone .2) Giant Hanuman speaks with Maa Sita : If you read Hanuman Chalisa "" Sukshma roop dhari Siya hi dhikava "" ~ In a small , gentle form you appear in front of Sita Maa , can't you get that right ?3) Asgard Lanka : Lanka is one of the most beautiful city ever created , why did you darken it , it is made of steel .4) Ravan always cunning : According to scriptures Ravan is one of the most intelligent person , he is an astrologist , he is the knower 4 Vedas and 6 Upanishads . In this movie he was always shown cunning and dumb .5) Vanarsena : could be compared to Early Humans , but here they are shown as monkeys 6) Rama asks Vanarsena to fight for him : Rama never asked or encouraged the Vanarsena to fight for him , he just asked Sugreeva to help him .7) Rama : Lord Rama , calm and composed at all situations , but he is always shown aggresive .8) Hairstyles and Dressing : If you look at them , it feels like some tik tokers were in the movie . Ravan army with some darth vader masks , Ravan with a tik tok hairstyle .And I at least expected some powerful scenes to have an impact . They had no impact . Scenes like Jambvant encouraging Hanuman , Hanuman bringing Sanjeevani , Ram Setu , nothing was powerful , it was so cheap . It could be ignored in OTT as well . Please watch Ram Anand Ramayan , it was so beautiful.Please , if you can't write a basic story on Ramayan don't . We won't accept this , why should you change our history . Leave VFX , at least the casting , or at least the story line wasn't perfect . A 6 years old kid knows the story better than you.

Adipurush is here to redefine the meaning of cinematic catastrophe! If you're desperately seeking a way to induce sleep or want to test your endurance for mind-numbing boredom, this movie is your golden ticket.Adipurush is the epitome of cinematic catastrophe that should come with a warning label: ""Watch at your own risk... of extreme boredom!"" This movie takes a captivating mythological story and transforms it into a mind-numbing disaster. The acting is as lively as a rock, the special effects resemble a cheap magic show gone wrong, and the dialogue is so cringe-worthy, it could make a stand-up comedian cry. Save yourself the agony and preserve your precious brain cells by avoiding this abomination of a film. Trust me, life is too short to waste on Adipurush.

Ramayan is a timeless epic that has defined the personification of Godly Goodness in humans like Sri Ram & Demonic Ego like Ravan. We all are obsessed with this story that has shaped our culture, religion & society in a way like nothing else. So, it needs to be shown in a grand scale with great characters if someone dares to show it on a big screen. But, Om Raut & team has made a parody of Ramayan on a grand scale. Shame on Manoj Muntashir for writing such C grade dialogues for an epic that defines the soul of our ethics & dharma. He should be put behind bars for spoiling the greatness of our eternal heroes.

This film is never adopted from Ramayana rather this movie has been created on mind creation of director who acted as mordern chapri. Prahas played a weak role. Even he was in bahubali you can never imagined. This movie is resentment of millions of religious people. Even dialogue is road side discussion of underage teen. Kindly move on from Bollywood drama they are not going save heritage of India but flatter the particular target of religious people. Lastly but sadly this movie will effect minds of youngsters and delude our future generation perceptive of Ramayana. Kindly save the heritage and culture from this gang.

85,18 June 2023," A Disastrous Disguise of the Epic: Adipurush Falls Flat on Its Face
","
Adipurush, touted as an epic retelling of the Ramayana, turns out to be an absolute disappointment that utterly fails to capture the essence and grandeur of the ancient epic. From its cringe-worthy bat dialogs to its questionable casting choices and misrepresentations of the Ramayana, this film is a colossal letdown.Let's start with the bat dialogs. It's mind-boggling how the filmmakers thought it would be a good idea to include such juvenile and ridiculous dialogues in a supposedly epic movie. The usage of modern slang and language completely undermines the authenticity and reverence that should have been accorded to the Ramayana. It feels like the writers were more interested in pandering to a younger audience rather than treating the source material with respect.Next comes the casting, which is nothing short of a disaster. While Prabhas may be a popular actor, he is woefully miscast as Lord Rama. His portrayal lacks the depth, charisma, and regal aura that one would expect from the legendary character. The casting decision feels more like a marketing gimmick aimed at capitalizing on Prabhas' star power rather than a thoughtful choice to bring the character of Lord Rama to life.The misrepresentation of the Ramayana is perhaps the most egregious offense committed by Adipurush. The filmmakers have taken significant liberties with the original story, distorting key elements and diluting its cultural and spiritual significance. The epic is a revered and cherished part of Indian heritage, and it deserved a faithful adaptation that respects its core values and teachings. Instead, Adipurush presents a watered-down version that does a disservice to the original text and its followers.Moreover, the film fails to create a cohesive narrative and struggles to maintain a consistent tone. The pacing feels uneven, with unnecessary deviations and subplots that add nothing substantial to the overall story. This lack of focus undermines the emotional impact and fails to capture the epic scale and timeless appeal of the Ramayana.In terms of visual effects and production design, Adipurush falls short of expectations as well. The CGI feels artificial and unconvincing, failing to create a seamless blend between the real and the mythical worlds. The film's set designs lack the grandeur and attention to detail that would have brought the ancient era to life. It feels like a missed opportunity to create a visually stunning and immersive experience.All in all, Adipurush is a misfire on multiple fronts. Its bat dialogs, questionable casting choices, and misrepresentations of the Ramayana leave a bitter taste in the mouths of those who were eagerly anticipating a faithful and awe-inspiring retelling of the epic. It's a disservice to the rich cultural heritage it claims to represent and an example of how not to adapt a beloved story. Save your time and seek out other adaptations that do justice to the epic tale of the Ramayana.

If you keep the story aside for it's largely known to all, the execution turns out to be a messy blend of over-the-top CGI and passable VFX, and making it worse are the intentionally funny dialogues that sound misplaced in a sensitive and mythological story. Why would you want Hanuman to say 'Jalegi tere baap ki'?""Better to watch the ancient Ramayana rather then wasting time on this so called Epic.

What was it? How can Prabhu Bajrang Bali talk like Dharavi ka Tapori? Lanka was looking like a darna manaa hai movie's haunted house. Prabhas had same expressions throughout the movie and I have to respect John's acting now. Prabhas was looking like animated body builder and Bajrang was forgetting to keep air in mouth in between scenes. Sometimes Bajrang had swallowed lips and sometimes normal. Om Raut and Bhushan Kumar are selling garbage. Every monkey from Ramanand Sagar's Ramayana did better job than Adipurush's Director/Producer/Actor/Actress/Technician all of them together. VFX is so poor and looks like a paint brush effects. Bollywood should stay away from epic, extravagant, magnificent, history and VFX. This is so bad that I was blaming myself why I wasted my money on this? I should have donated this money to poor people outside railway station and they would have given me blessings which would have been much better than this film.DISGUSTING!.

If the young minds of today get their understanding of Valmiki Ramayana from this movie then I don't know what will happen in near future.Overall this movie is an unbareable garbage which no devotee of Shree Rama or any person in general deserves to witness and atleast not by spending money. Don't watch it.Worthless

Prabhas is guilty by association this low type of production. First trailer was great indicator of upcoming disaster. Its amazing that you have all the answer of the exams prior and you still manage to get fail. This requires special set of skill to all the material you had for research and benchmark and still produce such garbage. Manoj Muntashir wrote such dialogs that you usually seen Anil Kapoor saying playing thug or Ranbir Singh playing himself. Stupidity of this production have changed the public eye to see Prabhas as actor. I feel more bad for Prabhas than bad representation of timeless tale.

I've never heard of any scripture or seen Ravana wearing a mask & performing welding, haha.I doubt these Bollywood beings plotted to ruin Prabhas's career.

I cannot even begin to express my absolute rage and frustration after enduring the mind-numbing disaster that is ""An Agonizing Journey."" This abysmal excuse for a film not only wasted my precious time but also managed to insult my intelligence with its sheer incompetence.From the very start, it became painfully clear that the filmmakers had no idea how to construct a coherent and engaging narrative. The plot stumbled aimlessly from one scene to another, lacking any semblance of structure or purpose. It was a chaotic mess that left me questioning why I bothered to invest even a moment of my life in this drivel.If the abhorrent storytelling wasn't enough to enrage me, the agonizingly slow pace pushed me to the brink of insanity. Each scene dragged on for an eternity, as if the filmmakers took pleasure in torturing their audience. I couldn't help but wonder if they had a bet going on who could create the most unbearable cinematic experience. Congratulations, you won!The characters in this cinematic catastrophe were as lifeless as a corpse in a morgue. Their motivations were vague and their actions inexplicable. I felt zero connection or empathy towards any of them, as they stumbled through the film like clueless puppets. It was a baffling display of lazy writing and uninspired performances that left me seething with anger.Let's not forget the technical aspects, or should I say lack thereof. The cinematography was a disgrace, featuring unimaginative shots and a complete disregard for visual storytelling. It was as if the cameraperson had fallen asleep and accidentally pressed record. And don't even get me started on the drab color grading and forgettable soundtrack. It was a cacophony of mediocrity that assaulted my senses.To call this film ""regional"" would be an insult to regional cinema. It failed to capture any essence of its supposed cultural backdrop, reducing it to a laughable backdrop devoid of authenticity. It was a slap in the face to the rich tapestry of regional storytelling, and I resent the filmmakers for their blatant disregard.The most infuriating aspect of this whole ordeal was the complete lack of emotional impact. I went into this film hoping to be moved, to be touched by the human experience. Instead, I was left cold and empty, with no trace of the promised emotional journey. It was an insult to my emotions and a blatant waste of my time.In conclusion, ""An Agonizing Journey"" is a shameful testament to the incompetence of its creators. It is a prime example of everything that can go wrong in filmmaking. From the haphazard storytelling to the lifeless characters and the technical disaster, this film fails on every possible level. I urge you, fellow moviegoers, to spare yourself the agony and avoid this abomination at all costs.

I couldn't watch it till the first interval. Costume sucks to the core. I bet they haven't even read the original novel Ramayana which is the movie based on. This movie's budget shouldn't be more than 50cr. I think the excess money they've paid for the caste but forgot to spend on the animation part which the the core part of the movie. Monkey fleet is like small kid army. Motivational part is not even 1% in the movie.

I think Om Raut should be banned from making any other movie. Worst story adaptation, more worst dialogue and on top of that use VFX use was again disappointing. I am still not able to digest how could someone with already a great story base can make such a worst movie. Just riding on emotional attachment might do some business but have no content to pull in audience. Atleast one who have seen the movie will only recommend anyone to watch if he/she want a revenge.

People can really learn from this movie. How not to make a movie, how not to write dialogues, how not to act and so on. This should be included actiing schools, direction schools, vfx courses as an example to people. I mean they have copied several movies, for thier vfx designs. This is why bollywood sucks. They copy everything, thinking people wont notice ? I mean how have they spend 600cr is beyond me. A youtuber can do a better job.Please dont go and watch this film. Its really bad. They should know , what they have done. This movie should get ban. Taking such a holy concept and making this kind of movie is a crime. Do they not watch thier own movie before release, if they do how a man with right mind can release such a movie.

As in our Indian tradition and culture,our gods have aura, peacefulness, happiness,hope and positivity on face,which missing,every god we pray have beautifully designed in old Ramayan their every uniqueness attracted us towards them, which is missing,we are very emotionally attached to our gods because of the way they talk to others even demon in a potile and respectfully and teach us moral values, to many things missing in adipurush.But from adipurush I learned,
Our gods have no control over language, ravan have stealth dragon from game of thrones, indrajit is the flash of DC universe,and much more.

This Movie deserves a one-way ticket to the trash bin of Cinematic History
This film has broken the heart of every person, this film should really be ban as it is putting wrong impression on the Ramayana as well as on the nation
This movie is an absurd joke on Valmiki Ramayana
I accept that Prabhas might be a big superstar but not bigger than Ramayana. Prabhas was playing every role accept Lord Ram
Saif Ali Khan was ok; He was confused between Raavan and Udaybhan Rathod
How the Hell can we recommend this movie to the entire world and say the We have made this and this is the actual Ramayana
The film starts with cheap and nonsense CGI
The dialogues were like the shop full of cringe. The level of pathetic dialogues it contained like 'Jali na Jalti hai sabki' 'Tere baap ka tel' 'Lanka laga di sabki'
The movie was supposed to take inspiration from Ramayana but it took inspiration from Avengers, GOT, Ghost Rider.

Absolutely horrible movie. If you love your brain and Sree Ram, you and your family must stay away from it. The dialogues are poorly written, the VFX is extremely pathetic, and even the look they gave to the characters is horrendous. What they did was an abomination is the name of Ramayana. They claim to have adapted a certain section of Ramayana but that too isn't true. The makers are not even justifying the title of the movie. Adipurush literally means the first man. How can Lord Ram be the first man. A very Abrahamicised way of looking at one of Hindus' most sacred texts. The Ramanand Sagar serial was much better.

You will not feel that that you are watching any real characters, looks like pogo vfx. Awesome
Om Raut is the best director who should get an Oscar for this masterpiece and i bet no one can even replicate for the same again.Overall, the popcorns were good in interval thats what i like the most.

The film attempts to bring to life an ancient mythological tale but ends up losing its way amidst a sea of unnecessary subplots and confusing character motivations. The audience is left struggling to connect the dots and make sense of the story, which ultimately hampers their overall engagement and enjoyment.The visual effects in Adipurash are another letdown. Given the grand scale of the mythological world it aims to portray, one would expect top-notch CGI and stunning visuals. Unfortunately, the execution falls flat, with glaring inconsistencies and poorly rendered sequences that fail to transport the audience into the fantastical realm. The subpar visual effects become a constant distraction and undermine the overall immersion, making it difficult to suspend disbelief.

Went to this movie without much expectations. I knew this was not a movie worth spending money, however had a curiosity to see how bad this movie was made.Having such a huge budget & an Epic mythology which is close to heart for everyone, this could have been made as one of the best films ever produced. Such a disappointment in all aspects, be it storyline, characters, visual effects, dialogues, you name it, all equally bad.Key elements on Ramayana are either skipped or portrayed in the worst possible way..!! The way Lanka is portrayed seems so childish and cringe. 90% of the movie feels like a poorly executed cartoon.This movie should not be shown to young kids who might perceive a wrong impression about Ramayana.

It is unnatural for a movie to be this bad. Somebody somewhere thought of making the worst possible take on Ramayana with equally bad CGI, worked really hard to make it as substandard as possible, and the result is this movie. This could possibly the most expensive horrible movie made in the history of cinema. It is comical to think that somebody thought it made sense for a god to have dialogues which is similar to what you'll hear in a drunken brawl inside a bar.And the CGI? It is utterly unbelievable, hundreds of crores for this? This is something you'd expect from an early 2000s low budge video game. This movie is a travesty to the movie film industry.

No wonder why many apex stars refused to take cameo in this movie.There is scene where Hanuman says something like ""tere baap ka tel, tere baap ka kapada, jalegi tere baap ki"" !!

Such a disappointment. The makers have managed to make a mess of such a great story of ramayana. Actors performance -poor, dialogue writing - extremely poor, no emotional display. Even giving a rating of 1 is overhyping the performance of actors and this pathetic movie. The movie had lost the significant relevance of the ramayana story. The detailing in the costumes of the actors is forgotten in relevance to the time period. The emotional display in the movie is dismayal. Actors havent even tried to portray any kind of emotions . Further the movie is made in such dark mode that it sometimes feel difficuilt to even see the faces of the characters clearly. Extremely poor movie.

116,18 June 2023," ADIPURUSH: Tarnishing the expectation of Indian Mythology Lovers
","
Let me start with something positive. Movie started with a good note and ""Ram Siya Ram"" song gave spiritual pleasure to our ears. Background music and Songs of the movie were really good. But apart from that if I have to say anything about the movie, I must say that makers failed to do their homework while making this epic. Even if we will keep sentiments aside on the name of cinematic liberty, the makers made me feel that they dnt understand cinema. The screenplay is very poor and the dark theme of movie made us feel that we are watching Game of Thrones not Ramayan. Makers made us feel that during Banawaas time of Lord Ram, Surya Dev also went on exile. VFX, CGI and other visual effects were very poor which forced us to think where they have spent 550 crore. Was that even the real budget of the movie or just some Random numbers were given to create hype. Movie makers need to understand that in big budget movie, if money is being spent on paying the fee of movie stars then we cant make a good cinema. Good cinema can only be made if budget is being spent more on VFX, Dialogue writing, CGI etc. And less on paying fee of actors.Talking about actors the selection of Case were horrible. No offence to Prabhas obviously he is one of the biggest star of the Country but he don't look like Lord Ram from any angle. Off course the beauty of Kriti Sanon is exceptional but for Goddess Sita we need beauty plus someone who is having Indian Look. Extra sharp feature of Kriti failing her to look like Sita. Selecting Saif as Ravana is perhaps biggest selection disaster of history of movie Industry. O n top of that giving him Khilji like look just poured Ghee in the Fire. In my opinion if they would have selected Rajat Tokas as Lord Ram and Shweta Basu Prasad as Mata Sita, that would have been perfect selection. These two are not less than anyone when it comes to acting and also they would not have charged like Prabhas and Kriti. That money could have been spent on VFX, CGI and other Visuals so that at least we would have got some visual treat.If I have to talk about performances, Kriti somewhere did justice with Sita Mata character. But she couldn't able to do much because of her limited presence on Screen. Prabhas tried his best. He even did justice of his star power but he miserable failed to made us feel the presence of Lord Ram on big screen. His flat expression throughout the movie has made the things even worst and we couldn't able to connect ourselves from the movie. About Saif as Ravan, I literally have no words. Trailer made me feel that he must have done good performance wise but witnessing him in this character on big screen was most horrible part of the movie. If we will try to ignore his looks and appearance on the name of Cinematic Liberty, his performance made things even more worse. He was walking like a thanos and his dialogue delivery was soo poor that his presence on screen was causing irritation.At last I will only say , please keep yourself away from Adipurush. If you want to show story of Lord Ram to your children, better to go with 'Ramayan of Ramananda Sager'or even Japanese Cartoon movie 'The Legend of Prince Ram'.

Adipurush is Poor filmmaking example. The whole film is a collection of failed experiments.Parents please don't show this to your kids as Epic Ramayan if they are watching Ramayan for first time. This is really very misleading film.All 7 elements of Film failed : Setting, Conflict, Character, Dialogue, Theme, Plot, and Climax.1) Setting: 1/10: When attempting to incorporate a renowned epic into one's own imaginary universe, one must exercise extreme caution. Looks like some immature kids work.>>>No army of the dead existed under Ravan. It was a mockery, to see the skullman army.>>>Another mistake was making Lanka look like a dark, black castle . Lanka is a beautiful green place.>>>VFX Overdone : Instead of a handful, the screen was completely covered with peacocks, deers, and birds in several scenes. How could such a basic thing go unnoticed? It looked so cluttered.>>> Planet of Apes movie copied for Vanar Sena.>>> What a mess done with pushpak viman . Why why why extreme experiment and that also game of thrones as is copy no innovation.>>>That's a terribly dumb thing to do. As an alternative to jewellery, Sita's necklace single pearl is used for her tracing.2) Conflict : 1/10 : The scene where they teased Raghav about Sita's death was very silly. That didn't help show how angry Raghav was. Instead, it made Ravan look stupid.3) Character: 0/10 : Movie didn't do a good job of establishing Characters. Not good at all. Very bad casting .>>> Its known that Raghav was from Ayodhya and Ravan was from Lanka, it should have made sense that they looked like Natives.>>>Ravan looked liked more of Aryan than a Lanka native. Anyone who has watched Game of Thrones will know its as is copy of John Snow.>>>Laxman such an innocent face. No aggressiveness.>>>Sita is admired and respected as a graceful strong woman. The way the actress acted didn't do justice to Sita's role. She looked very stupid and fragile. In a scene where Hanuman does something funny, her response seems so foolish given the role she is in. Her dressing was copied from some old Nal Damyanti paintings and similar goose were seen in some scenes.>>>Raghav and Jaanki's connection could not be strengthened via songs too. It would have been more effective to show Jaanki and Raghav trekking through woods, enduring difficulties, and cooking and eating together rather than showing them in a glamorous setting surrounded by sunflower fields.>>> No connect between Raghav and Hanuman
Then Surpankha, Mandodari, Vibhishan. Meghnath - was the industry lack of people none of them fit the role. I will say TV serials which have made Ramayan did better casting.None of the Characters met the expectations of the role.4) Dialogue : 0/10: who approved dialogues even if writer wrote that stuff. As a team all failed.5/6) Theme/Plot: Negative points as film did blunder with the Epic Ramayan. Every possible mistake can be witnessed in this movie .7) Climax : what a bad ending ... audience who was sitting for 3 hrs need to absorb the emotions at end . However with the film which failed to engage from beginning what could be expected at end.---------
2 things which can be appreciated.1) Shiv upasana done by Ravan beautiful work.2) Raghav killing Vali, and it was clear why he had to shoot Vali from behind.

121,19 August 2023," ""Visually Struggling 'Adipurush' Misses the Mark: A Mythological Epic Hindered by Shoddy Visual Effects""
","
""Adipurush,"" the new Indian mythological action-fantasy film, presents a familiar tale with a star-studded cast, including Prabhas in the lead role. The movie's ambition to adapt elements from The Ramayana while bringing larger-than-life Hindu gods and epic battles to the screen is evident. However, it struggles to rise above its visual shortcomings, particularly its subpar and distractingly artificial special effects.The narrative revolves around the courageous hero Raghava (Prabhas), also known as Ram, who sets out to rescue his kidnapped wife Sita (Kriti Sanon) from the clutches of the evil multi-headed god Lankesh/Ravana (Saif Ali Khan). The film's title, ""Adipurush,"" meaning ""First Man"" in Sanskrit, hints at its mythological themes and the grandeur it aspires to achieve.Unfortunately, the film's visual effects undermine its potential greatness. The amateurish and unconvincing computer-generated imagery detracts from the immersive experience, making the first part of the film feel tedious and uninspiring. Despite the high budget, the shoddy green-screen compositing and poorly-rendered elements overshadow the otherwise captivating narrative.Prabhas' charismatic presence and his initial confrontation with demonic wraiths offer moments of excitement, but the film's technical shortcomings become increasingly evident as the story unfolds. The scenes involving Sita and Raghava's romantic moments encircled by poorly-executed pink flamingos exemplify the film's struggle to create a believable world.Additionally, the musical numbers, particularly those involving Sita and Lankesh, suffer from lackluster visuals and fail to generate the desired emotional impact. The film's poetic song lyrics and expository dialogue often come across as forced and contrived. The characters' movements often serve to highlight the deficiencies of the computer-generated graphics, diminishing the overall quality of the film.Despite its derivative nature, borrowing elements from popular series like ""Game of Thrones"" and ""Lord of the Rings,"" as well as the ""Baahubali"" films, ""Adipurush"" manages to salvage some dramatic tension in its concluding battles. The showdown between Raghava, his brother Sesh/Laxmana, and the formidable Lankesh and his second-in-command Indrajit provides a narrow focus that delivers sporadic moments of engagement.Director Om Raut, known for his work on ""Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior,"" attempts to infuse the film with grandeur, particularly in its climactic battle scenes. Yet, even as the film gradually escalates towards its finale, the subpar visual effects persist, inhibiting the realization of its full potential.In the end, ""Adipurush"" grapples with the paradox of aiming for epic proportions while being hindered by its own technical limitations. While the film's cast and its ambitious narrative offer glimpses of promise, its glaring visual flaws and lack of visual finesse ultimately prevent it from achieving the grand cinematic spectacle it aspires to be. I would rate the film a 5/10 due to its disappointing visual execution and missed opportunities to create a truly immersive mythological experience.

First and foremost, the plot is a convoluted mess. It jumps around without any clear direction or coherence, making it impossible to invest in the story or connect with the characters. The filmmakers seem to have thrown random ideas together without any consideration for storytelling or logical progression. It's as if they relied on a series of poorly written clichés to pass as a narrative. The characters are equally abysmal. They lack depth, development, or any redeeming qualities that would make them remotely interesting. The performances are wooden and uninspired, further exacerbating the problem. It's almost painful to watch these actors struggle with the poorly written dialogue, as if they themselves realize how awful the movie is.

What was it? How can Prabhu Bajrang Bali talk like Dharavi ka Tapori? Lanka was looking like a darna manaa hai movie's haunted house. Prabhas had same expressions throughout the movie and I have to respect John's acting now. Prabhas was looking like animated body builder and Bajrang was forgetting to keep air in mouth in between scenes. Sometimes Bajrang had swallowed lips and sometimes normal. Om Raut and Bhushan Kumar are selling garbage. Every monkey from Ramanand Sagar's Ramayana did better job than Adipurush's Director/Producer/Actor/Actress/Technician all of them together. VFX is so poor and looks like a paint brush effects. Bollywood should stay away from epic, extravagant, magnificent, history and VFX. This is so bad that I was blaming myself why I wasted my money on this? I should have donated this money to poor people outside railway station and they would have given me blessings which would have been much better than this film.DISGUSTING!

This movie intends to manipulate history so the further generation can be even more manipulated in terms of the history and Culture of Bharat...Their is not even single fact which is taken into consideration while filming the movie... it's absolute mockery of Ramayana...where
1. Golden Lanka - turn Coal Mine..
2. Hanuman ji and Vanar Sena has been tried to portray as today is what people called Monkeys..
3. Whole attire (dhoti and Ang vastra is change into some random chapri costume)
4. Ravana's Sabha and Kingdom are non existent..
5. Sexualisation of Vibhishna Wife..
6. Asura has been made like zombies.This is the worst thing ever happened.

127,4 July 2023," ""Adipurush: A Misguided Representation of Ramayana""
","
""Adipurush"" stands as a grave disappointment, offering one of the worst representations of the epic Ramayana that I have seen to date. The mischaracterizations, sloppy storyline, and inaccurate representations make for a film that does not do justice to the epic it attempts to retell.The leading actor's portrayal of the principal character is lackluster and fails to capture the essence of the role. This discrepancy is evident in every frame, making the performance not just forgettable but also deeply frustrating.However, the greatest fault of ""Adipurush"" lies in its depiction of Ravan and his ethnicity. Traditionally known as dark-skinned Rakshashas, the portrayal of Ravan as a light-skinned Northerner is a considerable misrepresentation that undermines the rich diversity of our epics. This inaccurate depiction feels like a forced attempt to align the characters of Ravan and Ram, which doesn't resonate with the epic's true spirit.Despite these glaring issues, Saif Ali Khan's performance is a silver lining. He delivers a strong portrayal and proves his mettle as an actor. But, his casting as Ravan feels misplaced; given his strong performance, he would have been better suited for the roles of Ram or Hanuman.The narrative of ""Adipurush"" is equally disappointing. The storyline is sloppy and riddled with plot inconsistencies, creating an experience that is more confusing than engaging.In conclusion, ""Adipurush"" is a poor adaptation that fails on multiple fronts. It misrepresents the characters of the Ramayana and fails to deliver a coherent and engaging storyline. Despite Saif Ali Khan's commendable performance, the film remains a cinematic misfire. It serves as a grim reminder of the responsibility that comes with adapting beloved epics. We can only hope that future attempts will be more considerate and accurate in their portrayals.

Badly presented.Also, the writer Manoj Muntashir doesn't know history well. For example, he said, ""Nepal is a part of India, hence, I wrote 'Bharat ki beti'"". C'mon!The audacity! He doesn't know history at all. How was he given to write the dialogues?Secondly, the dialogues! It boils the blood of a true Hindu to see such language. I hope it gets banned all over the world.Also, the animation was terrible. I think a YouTuber content is far better than the animation done in the movie.I don't think anyone should waste a penny watching the movie as I did. Better read or watch 1987 Ramayan.The actors did what they were told, so, no hate to the actors.The movie had nothing to do with the epic story, let alone the dialogues.

For a second, let us all forget that we have heard, read or watched another adaptation of the Ramayana. Especially, we must not compare with Ramanand Sagar's Ramayan. Let us even assume that this movie has nothing to do with any religious beliefs.Even then, this movie is a big let down. The duration of this movie is 2h50. About 2h30 of it was without dialogues and/or acting. You simply have to watch it to believe it.Am never ever watching any movie from this director, or Prabhas if that matters.For someone who does not know the Ramayana, this movie will not even make sense. Nothing was explained. Worst movie of recent times imo.

I recently watched the movie ""Adipirush"" with great anticipation, hoping for a respectful and accurate representation of Hindu beliefs. However, I found it to be a disheartening experience that deeply hurt my Hindu sentiments. It is regrettable that ""Adipirush"" missed the mark entirely, doing a disservice to the Hindu community and failing to uphold responsible storytelling. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone, especially those who hold their Hindu beliefs dear. The careless depiction in ""Adipirush"" not only failed to respect the core values and practices of Hinduism but also missed an opportunity to promote harmony and empathy among diverse religious communities. It is my hope that future filmmakers approach Hindu themes with greater sensitivity and strive for authentic portrayals that foster understanding and respect.

This movie is a black spot on Indian cinema. It has insulted our religion. How can lord hanuman use such cheap dialogues. They have made ramanyana into a masala film. Ravan has a fade cut. Seriously? What kind of joke is this? Lord Ram has a tapori moustache. He was looking like a panvadi in this movie not lord ram. Boycott this rubbish movie. And today the director has come out and basically said that the audience is shouting jai Shree ram and enjoying the movie in theatres. I don't know which theatre he is talking about because it didn't happen in mine. Anyway, don't watch this movie because you will get extremely angry after watching it.

Adipurush is a poorly made, poorly acted, and poorly written film that is a big disappointment to us. The film is visually stunning, but that is about all it has going for it. The story is boring, the characters are one-dimensional, and the dialogue is cringeworthy. The action scenes are poorly choreographed and the special effects are laughable. The film's biggest problem is its lead actor, Prabhas. Prabhas is a charisma vacuum who brings nothing to the role of Ram. He is wooden and lifeless, and he fails to emote even the simplest of emotions. The supporting cast is also unimpressive.Overall, Adipurush is a disappointing film. It is a waste of time and money, and it is not worth watching.

To start with; the movie title doesnt fit the so called story of Sri Rama. This is the worst version some one can depict. I think this is some sort of propaganda against Hindus and distorted the complete story of Ramayana. I have grown up watching Ramayana, listening to stories related to Ramayana. But this one ....Oh .... What to say? The worst of all. My kid would do a better VFX than the one used here. Characters doesn't suit at all. I don't see even one scene which is worth appreciating. This is total garbage for almost 3hours. I wish someone can refund my money for wasting 3hrs of time. Story is pathetic, Characterization is pathetic with zero knowledge about Ramayana. Dialogues are utter non-sense, this matches the dialect of a Delhi Chor bazar guy. The conspiracy can be seen here where our Sita Maa is seen as beheaded by Ravana. What non-sense. I would urge people to not watch this movie and if possible take legal action against the producers and directors for making this movie and distorting our history. Jai Sri Ram, Jai Anjaneya, Jai Bharath!!!

I gave this movie a chance because somewhere I felt it was a vision that Om Raut had and the audience did not accept it. But , man was I wrong... The film is a hot mess right from the beginning where they set up an action sequence to introduce Ram, I have no problem if your idea is to show the yudha kaanda in a commercial, marvel style presentation. But what are those demons? Who are they, why are they there, why was Rama fighting them??? Just pure lazy writing....Secondly, why is Lakshman/Sesh just there? Instead of Ram being a brother / uttamapurush teaching him morals, he just comes out as an annoying character with that stone face expression in the first half before saying something and Ram correcting him. And in the second half of the film just being there for the sanjeevani sequence...There is no real emotional connection with any of the characters, except for the part where Ram and Hanuman meet for the first time. And Sita, omg, why is she there to only say a few mass dialogues to Ravana every 10 mins.... That is all she does in the film. A pure commercial film heroine.They failed to create a connection with Jatayu, Sugreev even Ram... They just tell you that he's a man of honor, with no embodiment in the characters.I'm okay with modernizing the characters and all. And willing to excuse the poor art direction and VFX, if they were sincere in making a good movie. But this genuinely feels like a rushed , commercial product with the idea being make ""money with action"". Even then, the action sequences are awfully choreographed too....

It was a big big wait for this movie, but honestly speaking, most of the audiences would have gone irritated while watching the movie.The movie was something related to Ram katha, where people had a positive expectation for having some religious chores with more spiritual and standard dialogues for such great characters,like Shri Ram, Shri Hanuman, Ravan, Meghnad etc, but it was a total disappointment.The whole movie is either inspired from Hollywood Adventures or some ghost stories. Even the animated Ramayan was far better than this.Had Manoj Muntashir some brain or aptitude, he must not have written such weird dialogues.In fact, he seems to be a cheater, who copies/imitates/steals songs and dialogues from some unknown movies ans serials.

The movie in question suffers from several notable flaws. Firstly, the CGI effects fail to deliver a sense of immersion and fall short of expectations. The dialogue presentation is also lackluster, lacking depth and failing to engage the audience effectively. Moreover, the storyline feels unoriginal, drawing heavily from other well-known series, which hampers its ability to offer a unique and captivating narrative.It is important to address a factual inaccuracy within the film as well. The claim that Sita, a character in the movie, belongs to Nepal rather than India is historically accurate. Nepal has its own distinct cultural heritage, and it was never a part of India.Overall, these shortcomings in CGI effects, dialogue presentation, and originality of the storyline detract from the movie's overall quality. Viewers seeking a more engaging and authentic cinematic experience may find themselves disappointed. It is advisable to approach this film with lowered expectations and consider exploring alternative options that better meet your preferences.

Firstly beginning with the opening scene...why do we need dementors from Harry Potter?? Wouldn't it be better to see the opening scene as the day before Lord Ram's coronation and how the next day he instead has to go for vanvas. I wanted to see the opulence and grandeur of Lanka, not a dark and gloomy Mordor with orcs.The movie lacked a strong background narrative in most required scenarios like Shabari, Jatayu,Mandodari, ,Meganad, Jamvat,Lord Hanuman etc. The emotional connect was truly lost. The epic has such strong characters emotions and not a milligram of them conveyed through the movie. Lord Hanuman who is known for his perfect grammar, speech and the Lord of 8 siddhis ( superpowers) cannot say road side slang ...please. He has the power to be as small as an atom , to grow has heavy as a mountain and so on an so forth.Ravan was a Brahma gyani one who has knowledge of the universe. An engineer, music maestro,Astrology, Ayurveda, inventor of Veena and other 55 qualities. He had 11 airports and please didn't need a weird bat with dragon voice from Game of thrones to fly around. His viman ( plane) worked on voice recognition system .It was an epic battle between two supermassive supreme beings. And very humbly Lord Ram brought Ravan to his knees and broke his pride.I would suggest one rather watch The Legends of Ramayan by Amish on Discovery plus. So beautifully explained with true locations and deep insight.Lastly when you are making a movie on Lord Ram , do not be afraid to say Jai Shri Ram , Jai Hanuman 🙏.

When I saw the trailer, I was really happy seeing all the VFX and good actors though i was a little embarassed looking at the costumes but the movie was so unfair and a total disaster.......

This is the worst movie based on Ramayana. The dialogues are low class and certainly not for an epic like Ramayana. Prabhas looks artificial and his dressing in certain scenes looks like Jesus Christ and there's no mukut for any of them. Saif Ali Khan looks like a buffoon, I mean he's playing Ravana who was a Shiv Bhakt and a Brahman, but this buffoon looks like a low class Mugal hijd@.... If someone is making a movie on Ramayana then they have to stick to it, they cant get away with words like ""Modern Day Ramayana"" and ""Creative Liberties"", this movie was done on purpose to hurt Hindu sentiments.

A sacred book to billions of people, the Ramayan. People revere it as a holy religious literature. The Ramayan has been the subject of numerous television shows, motion pictures, and animated films, but no one has attempted to degrade it.This inexperienced and unsuccessful director mixed scenes from various Hollywood films with the Ramayan, which is completely improper. The clothing, conversations, VFX, and mutual respect were all depicted in a highly incorrect manner that was undoubtedly not true to the Ramayan. Go to other versions instead of watching it.VFX nowadays is inferior to what it was in the 1980s. Only money paid to the media is supporting the movie.Now director is claiming that it's not based on ramayana but it clearly visible they advertise it as ramayana . Totally disappointed.

They have made some fantasy genre film. This film does not represent our ramayan in anyway. The dialogues, screen play and most importantly the vfx everything is total disaster. We cant even feel connected to the characters and most importantly the casting has been done so wrong for this film. Prabhas has not done justice to lord rama at all. His acting in bahubali was much much better than this. The worst part about the film is that they have not even shown the balya kand and the ram - sita swayamvar which is the most most important part of ramayan. Totally disappointed with the film im sorry.

This is a joke in the name of the epic Ramayana. Necessary actions should be taken against the makers for playing with human sentiments. There is NO research done on any aspect before taking up this venture. The film is a sheer 3 hrs torture. It is a mockery to the sanatan God's and the film is not only derogatory but outright vile and vulgar in multiple levels. If they had so much money to shell out could have donated to the needy. These thick skinned rhinos will yet continue to do such pigshit in future to that thought breaks my heart. They think their target audience are guniea pigs and could be served any amount of filth in the name of a film.

","
Adipurush is not only one of the worst cinematic adaptations of Ramayan ever made, but also a shoddy, and offensive treatment to the parent chronicle of Lord Ramchandra's pastimes in Ayodhya and His 14 years long exile.There is not a single character that has been seriously presented. The movie makers intention was probably to mock the entire gravity and seriousness of this epic. Dialogues are offensive. I was shocked by what was playing on the screen. What made the makers think that such a non-serious and in fact insulting attempt would be lauded? The sheer assumption that the audience was so uninformed about ""Ramayan"" as a text is appalling.Om Raut needs to be introspect of what he has done with the source material like that of Valmikiji's timeless epic, Ramayan. He has completed done away with its ""dharmik"" essence. No research has been done or at least that is what it looks like. The screenplay is discontinuous and uninteresting. It alters significant events from the Ramayan without any plausible reason. The scenes do not register gracefully. There is legit no emotional connect for characters. Actions scenes have directly been picked up from Hollywood movies. The performances are mediocre to poor, mostly tending towards the latter. One is forced to wonder where did the 700 crores go? What was going on in the minds of the makers when they were writing and directing such a movie? How did the actors agree to be a part of this futile effort for an adaptation? They had the audacity to call this hostile adaptation a ""work of devotion""? Seriously?The lesser is said about other aspects of the movie the better. I already feel like I need to cleanse my eyes after the mess that I watched. Adipurush appears to be a work of hostility and planned insult to Lord Ram and His pastimes. Sadly, the makers of the film (Director Om Raut and writer Manoj Muntashir) promoted it as some monumental effort to glorify Lord Ram. At least, it doesn't come across as that.

There should be option of giving negative review too.Anyways I will like to give a genuine feedback about this movie: Stupid storytelling way, Manoj Munatoshir should take half responsibility of this disaster and then whosoever responsible for casting in the movie. Prabhas can never be portrayed as Ram, he can be Bhima or duryodhan if someone will make Mahabharat in future. Every time he appears on screen as Shri Ram it disappoints! We have loved Prabhas in his earlier characters like superhero but this time a big No !!!This movie should be banned as it's hurting sentiments of hindu.Kirti Sanon is still good in her character.

Adipurush, a Bollywood adaptation of the revered Ramayana, is a profound insult to Hindu scriptures. This film disappoints on every level, disrespecting the essence of the source material and tarnishing the heritage it represents.The casting choices are a major letdown. Saif Ali Khan's portrayal of Ravan lacks the larger-than-life presence the character demands, with a laughable hairstyle and pathetic costumes. Kriti Sanon fails to capture the essence of Sita Mata, while Prabhas' portrayal of Lord Ram is a disgrace, lacking the nobility and composure associated with the revered figure.Director Om Raut's ineptitude is evident, with poor direction, a lackluster screenplay, and cringe-worthy dialogues. The film's exorbitant budget is wasted on subpar VFX and graphics that would be better suited to a high school project.Adipurush not only defames the history of India and Maryada Purushottam Shri Ram but also showcases a shocking level of depravity. The filmmakers insult the holy Ramayana and its characters, with no respect for the cultural values they represent.I urge all Hindus to boycott this movie, as it distorts our mythology and insults our scriptures. Adipurush is a disgraceful attempt at storytelling that should be avoided. Instead, turn to the authentic glory of the Ramayana in its original texts.

This movie is a disgrace, showing blatant disrespect for the sanctity and legacy of Ramayana. The writing is abysmal, the direction is atrocious, and the visual effects are horrendous. To make matters worse, the film incorporates sleazy and repugnant content. The lead actor's portrayal falls flat, looks like a FAT Halwai rather than the revered Shri Ram. Prabhas, in his role as Shri Ram, lacks any semblance of expression and comes across as wooden. Saif, playing Ravan, fails to bring any depth to the character and instead resorts to a growling and malevolent persona. Sunny Singh's portrayal of Laxman is devoid of emotion, as he remains stone-faced throughout. The depiction of Hanuman is utterly appalling, with the actor portraying as a foul mouth showing a complete disregard for the greatness of the character. In summary, this film is a complete affront to the essence of Ramayana and should never be endorsed with your hard-earned money,. Prabhas, Om Raut, Manoj Muntashir, and T-Series should hang their heads in shame for their involvement in this project. DONOT WATCH THIS IN THEATERS.

163,19 June 2023," Baseless, Technical errors, Ramayana from another planet

Aadipurush, the much-anticipated mythological epic, falls flat on its face, leaving audiences with a sense of profound disappointment and dissatisfaction. Directed by a renowned filmmaker, one would expect a masterpiece that transcends boundaries and delivers an immersive experience. Unfortunately, this film fails to live up to even the most basic expectations, making it one of the worst movies of 2023.One of the most glaring issues with Aadipurush is its lackluster execution. Despite its ambitious premise, the film fails to create a captivating mythological world. The production design feels uninspired and lacks attention to detail. The sets and costumes appear generic and fail to transport viewers into the mythical era they are meant to represent. The visual effects, touted as one of the film's strengths, are underwhelming, with poorly rendered CGI that often takes viewers out of the experience rather than enhancing it.The performances in Aadipurush are equally disappointing. Prabhas, in the role of Lord Rama, delivers a wooden and uninspiring portrayal. His lack of emotional depth and charisma make it difficult to connect with his character, leaving a void at the center of the narrative. Saif Ali Khan's Ravana, touted as a revelation, is nothing more than a caricature of evil, lacking the complexity and depth needed to make the character truly memorable. The chemistry between the leads is non-existent, and their encounters feel forced and devoid of any genuine emotion.The screenplay of Aadipurush fails to bring anything new or thought-provoking to the table. It follows a predictable narrative trajectory that offers no surprises or innovative twists. The dialogue is often trite and lacks impact, failing to leave a lasting impression. Additionally, the film suffers from pacing issues, with several scenes feeling unnecessarily dragged out, resulting in a bloated runtime that tests the audience's patience.While mythological films often have the potential to explore timeless themes and provide social commentary, Aadipurush falls short in this regard. It fails to offer any fresh perspective or relevance to the contemporary world, making the narrative feel hollow and disconnected from the audience's reality. The film relies too heavily on the familiarity of the source material, assuming that the audience's prior knowledge will fill in the gaps and compensate for the lack of depth in the storytelling.Moreover, Aadipurush suffers from poor editing choices. There are jarring cuts between scenes, disrupting the flow and coherence of the narrative. The film lacks a strong editorial hand, resulting in a disjointed experience that feels like a collection of loosely connected scenes rather than a cohesive story.In conclusion, Aadipurush is a colossal disappointment and unquestionably one of the worst movies of 2023. Its lackluster execution, uninspired production design, and underwhelming performances make it a forgettable addition to the genre of mythological epics. The film fails to deliver on its promise of a grand cinematic experience and falls short in every aspect that matters: storytelling, visuals, performances, and emotional engagement.As audiences, we deserve better than Aadipurush. It serves as a cautionary tale of how even the most promising projects can go astray when not executed with care and creativity. This film will only leave viewers longing for a more compelling and imaginative retelling of the mythological tale it attempts to portray. It is best to avoid Aadipurush and seek out other cinematic experiences that truly resonate and leave a lasting impact.

""Adipurush"" had the potential to bring the epic Ramayana to life, but unfortunately, it falls short of expectations. The portrayal of Lord Hanuman with roadside-style dialogues and the underutilization of Lord Laxman leave much to be desired. Prabhas' performance as Lord Ram lacks expression and emotional depth. However, Saif Ali Khan stands out as a convincing Raavan, while Kriti Sanon's limited screen time hampers her portrayal of Sita. The visual effects appear cartoonish, and the soundtrack fails to evoke the necessary emotions. Overall, ""Adipurush"" fails to capture the emotional resonance and character depth of the Ramayana, making it a disappointing adaptation.

165,31 August 2023," A lazy version of Ramayana critiqued by a Hindu (closet ashiest)
","
I am a Hindu who grew up in India. Most people know about Ramayana thanks to an epic serial made in late 80s by Ramanand Sagar. Additionally, Ramayana is part of lots of people growing up in North India thanks to Ramleela. Ramleela is street theater that takes place a week before Dusherra (20 days before diwali) on street corners everywhere in North India. Ramleela depicts the story of Ramayana and each production takes their take depending on their budget and talent. I say this because I don't have any problem with producer Om Raut making their own artistic version. My problem is that his version is a lazy version where artistic liberties are taken and replaced with heavy dose of plagiarism or plain thoughtlessness.Let's start with dialogues. In the guise of being modern and relevant we have some really thoughtless words uttered by characters who would never speak in that manner.Editing and pacing of movie is slow and almost makes you go to sleep. There are just way too many slow motion shots and there is absolutely nothing natural about what you see.CGI is used extensively in this movie but unfortunately it is of very poor quality. You feel like you are watching and animation movie at all times.Lot of side characters are just lifted from western movies. Vanar Sena (Monkey army) looks like is lifted directly from planet of Apes. Ravana is desired to be shown bigger than others and that makes him looks he is floating and look they are trying to copy Thanos with a buzz cut. Asuras in lanka looks to be lifted directly from Orcs in Lord of the rings. Lanka is a direct copy of Asgard from Thor. Ravana looks to be riding the dragon from Game of Thrones.Thoughfulness and artistry is lacking and it instead is replaced by borrowed CGI and whole lot of nothing. Even though I am not religious it looks this was a huge waste of money and opportunity.

This movie is an epic fail at capturing the true essence and spirit of the great Ramayana. The integrity, divinity, aesthetics and beauty of the characters and the revered scripture have been reduced to a mockery. I really don't know what the makers and especially the director was thinking while making such a disaster. There are plenty of sources for reference be it in Telugu film industry, Hindi film industry, Ramayana by Ramanand sagar or any anime or cartoon shows. They all have been legendary and have done an exemplary and sincere job at capturing the true beauty of Ramayana. Here, the scripture has been completely distorted for fulfilling the whims and fancies of the director. Too much creative liberty must not be attempted in historical and mythological projects as it makes the credibility of the entire film questionable which was the case in this film. The trailer itself was disappointing. The dialogues are absolutely horrible, making it too casual and slang filled for a divine project. In many of the dialogues even the original references and meanings have been distorted. Costumes, settings, Vfx nothing is up to the mark. Extremely disappointing. Even the actors' potential was not used to its fullest. Please avoid this movie! Its a waste of time. This is the worst portrayal of Ramayana ever in India.

How they killed Vali was short
Overall, the movie was useless, and a waste of time and money. I would not recommend watching Adipurush, but there are plenty of other great films based on Ramayana. One movie I would recommend is the Legend Of Prince Rama with 9.2 stars out of 10. It is a cartoon movie, but it is amazing based on when it was released and created.

This is one of the most disgusting adaption of a story with great religious & historical importance.I guess the main intention of this movie was only to convert all the illegally earned money by the director/producers into legal investment & declare loss to avoid paying taxes.Can't blame the actors for this abomination. They tried to play their roles in the best way possible. Hence the 2 star that I've given. It's only the crew who has to be blamed for this.Feels like the entire movie has been shot inside a bedroom or a small hall & to that the most pathetic & disgusting CGI is added. It costed ISRO 450cr for the Mangalyaan mission which benefited India & the scientists in its studies for about 10-15 years. This movie costing 600cr couldn't even have proper CGI. The 1987 Ramayana television series had better CGI than this.Why rename the three leads, i.e. Ram, Sita & Laksmana while the names of the rest of the characters remain the same/original.The Dialogues.... Oh My God!!! How did the CBFC approve this movie with such rubbish dialogues. It's More like a third grade standard less movie dialogues.To be honest there are much better historical adoptions made in a much better & economical way. The 1992 Japanese adoption of Ramayana had been produced & directed in the most respectable manner.Guys, please don't spend your valuable money on this so called movie. It's an insult to the movie industry. Save it so that you can spend on a different & more valuable movie. I could barely keep my eyes open for half the movie and I forced myself out of the theatre.I don't know what is wrong with Indian Cinema. The quality of its content is deteriorating movie by movie. Just adding big names to the cast list is not going to make the movie a success. Proper direction, screenplay, production, dialogues, etc, all contributes to a movies success. Most of the historically important stories are being adopted & portrayed in a wrong way or by the wrong cast.

So this movie Adipurush made with the whopping budget of 600 crores. With that huge money it didn't serve the purpose. Cast was so unreal that it couldn't connect with the audience and the dialogues they delivered was pathetic and kinda chapri language. Prabhas looks was so robotic less appearance just doesn't fit in the role of lord Ram. Saif and kriti did bit justice to their role but it wasn't enough to make this movie best. I appeal to all that please don't watch this movie and don't waste your money. They just insult the Hindu gods and twisted the ramayan based on their likings. Anyways this movie should be banned by the Indian government. A BIG NO to this movie.I could have given -10 but it doesn't allow here so only 1 star that too for the song Ram Siya Ram.

I don't know from where they added words like ""dhanda"", ""baap"" etc. It's another example of how one can take advantage of such celebrated , worshipped book and do whatever they feel.After seeing this , I think making films on Ramayan, Mahabharat should be banned from now (including this one called ""Adipurush"" rather than spoiling the original and misguiding the one who don't know.

It lowers the purity of our ramayna and values of its characters includes even Bhagwan Ram ,Sita Mata , Hanuman Ji and also Ravan.Ravan was not a good man but it does not mean that they should not respect his knowledge and strength.It made fun of hinduism,
Lord Hanuman ji never said anything wrongly and he made fun of him too. This mockery of Hindu religion will curse movie cinema that no movie will ever run. If they can't show it right, then they had no right to make fun of it. If these people have the courage, then they should show the correct things which are written in our book, then you all are afraid that Hinduism should not be glorified. God will never forgive you.

First of all a big shame on Manoj Muntashir, earlier had a great respect for him but after this ""joke"", he deserves zero respect.. He completely sell his self esteem to T- Series.In his recent Interviews, he is constantly saying everywhere after the release of this ""joke"", that he made such dialogues of this ""joke"" so that the youth of the nation can easily relate with it. So why don't you think about these things while you come on Reality TV Shows like Indian Idol,etc; and narrates a long story or recites poems on some topics..Rest all cast must be ashamed for themselves too..One side Kirti Sanon did Mimi - The Movie, which raised big social topic which was like taboo to our society, and then she did this ""joke"".Prabas was bearable only in Bahubali Series else he is not looking 1% Shri Ram in this ""Joke"".Om Raut made Tanhaji like masterpiece, but now he made biggest mistake of his life..Saif Ali Khan too is a great actor, and he proves this in many films like Race, Tanhaji, Omkara,etc. End of all the things, I personally think that T-Series forced or blackmailed all the cast and crew for their future. That's all..

180,18 June 2023," Total Garbage - Unbelievably low grade movie
","
Aadipurush is a mix of cringeworthy low-grade dialogues, excessive use of unnecessary CGI, poor casting and basic art of filmmaking totally out of place.Movies are considered one of the highest forms of art. Aadipurush in contrast should be considered as an example of how NOT to make a movie. After watching it viewers will be left contemplating that Aadipurush is not an attempt of filmmaking but the makers have taken it just as a commercial project to earn money by cashing in the recently rising religious sentiment in India. This is proven by interviews of ignorant filmmakers hurting sentiments of people within and neighboring countries. Manoj Muntashir in particular has demonstrated how pathetic his level of knowledge in history is and is utterly unqualified to be in any sort of filmmaking.Save yourself the trauma of wasting time and money and do not watch this piece of historic garbage.

This film is such a disaster. For people of India Ramayana is an epic and it should be treated with respect. Don't know why they try to modernise things this much rather than keeping it simple. Too much of bats, darkness and unnatural vfx. And specially the facts tampering like sabri coming to Ram ji, Vibhishan not telling about Ravana amrit kalash. Anghad going to Ravana mahal, sone ki lanka and many more. And then comes dialogues, why these type of dialogues.... rude to hear from hanuman ji or anyone else. Hairstyles and makeup pathetic. Plus no context of the movie is set. If they really wanted to do justice then they could have make 2-3 set of movies and show everything correctly without rushing and crushing over the facts. With this movie , younger generation will never learn who lord Rama is and how he fought for truth and dharma. And the piousness in him or anyone in the epic.Last but not the least , this is total disrespect in the hunt for money 😔

The movie is a total drag of unwanted action scenes with ultra 3rd class visual effects. Some scenes that can finish in 2-3 minutes were stretched for 12-15 minutes for no apparent reason.VFX were so bad that even tail of Hanuman ji wasn't shown connected to his back properly.How can you show seeta mata in half naked lower blouse? This was utterly disgusting.All in all, it was just to showcase how a classic mythological story can be directed in such a bad manner. Some facts were twisted, but the characters were shown badly. See, now we are disliking how raavan was shown. Needed respect for him too.

183,18 June 2023," WHAT's A BETTER WORD FOR WORST?
","
Well, today I finally watched the most anticipated movie, 'Adipurush.' I have been following many pages where it was said that this movie would give 'JAWAN' a good competition. However, I am sorry to say that this movie didn't live up to anyone's expectations.First of all, let's talk about the plot. You will see Amrendra Bahubali as Ram, delivering dialogues that are relatively similar to what he gave in 'Bahubali.' Then there's Kriti Sanon, portrayed as a super hot Satyug Kanya, whom we'll be calling 'Mata Sita.' There's a mute Laxman and a Hanuman who speaks Tapori language. The only pro factor in the movie is Ravana, played by Saif Ali Khan, and his role was well-acted, but unfortunately, our lovely director sabotaged it with excessive VFX. Kudos to him.Now, let's talk about the cinematography and animations of the movie. I think Bengali cartoons like 'Teni Da' have better animations than this movie. The movie relies heavily on animations, and even Indrajit, Ravana's son, has super vamp speed powers. It's like they knew they would be sharing the screen with Flash, so they gave him such powers. The animated Vanara, bats, and demons all had fake effects. None of them felt real. Even BHERIA MOVIE had better animations than these characters.Moving on to the dialogue, a mythological movie based on different mythological books was given poor dialogues. From Prabhas' portrayal of Ram, who doesn't sound anything like Maryada Purshottam, to Hanuman and Indrajit speaking in Tapori language. Even Sita's conversation with Ravana was quite disrespectful, as people in Satyug do not use words like 'tu' and 'chal.' Maybe the whole budget was spent on making nasty animations, which is why they couldn't hire someone to write Sanskrit lyrics for the movie.Finally, let's discuss the storyline. The challenge and advantage of making a mythological movie is that people already have an idea of the script. Those who have read the Vedas know what happened according to them, and those who know the story of Ramayana from cartoons or web series also have some idea. The script for such a movie should be clear, and the difficult part should be deciding what to show and what to omit from the story that people already know. You cannot manipulate the narrative that has been studied in the Vedas for years, but this movie has done just that. It has changed the perspective of what we were shown in Ramayan since our childhood days.I mean, where was it mentioned that Hanuman brought the entire mountain of Sanjeevani just because he thought it would be needed in the future? Or where was it shown that Laxman bathed in Sanjeevani water? Or that Ravana used a giant bat? Or that Ram and Laxman actually witnessed Ravana abducting Mata Sita and were chasing him to save her? I have no idea where the director found these stories. Where were these stories in Ramayana by Ramanand Sagar, or 'Siya Ke Ram' on Star Plus, or the cartoon Ramayan? I haven't read Valmiki's Ramayan, but I did read 'The Forest of Enchantment,' which is Sita's version of Ramayan.Did they happen to miss these details in the Ramayan which I have seen or read?I am confused!Furthermore, Sita should always be portrayed as a woman with dignity and self-respect. A TRUE FEMINIST. She is obviously beautiful, but that portrayal is missing here.Now I am convinced that BHRAMASTRA was a better movie with annoying dialogue SHIVA SHIVA SHIVA and a better VFX.

I just witnessed the most colossal disappointment ever.This movie was an absolute train wreck from start to finish. The writing, the VFX, everything was pure garbage.The only redeeming quality was the music. Everything else was an unfunny joke. The dialogue was cringe-worthy, and the costume designing was a complete disaster.I'VE NEVER FELT THIS LET DOWN BY A MOVIE BEFORE.The dialogue writing, in particular, was shockingly disrespectful, and it's a flaw that cannot be easily overlooked or forgiven.I find it difficult to comprehend how anyone could have approved of such a production.This film will be remembered for generations as an example of how a movie should not be made, a cautionary tale in the realm of filmmaking.

Poorest of poor direction cinematography and this movie is an insult to Hindus and our history.Banning this movie is essentially required immediatelyNo justice done to any of the characters in Ramayan.

I had gone to the theater to watch the origin story of Ramayana, but here I was being shown Marvel Avengers, that too with ridiculous dialogues. Many scenes of this movie are inspired from Hollywood movies.Very sad to see this film. Here the Chhapri director has completely changed the cultural Ramayana by getting intoxicated with cheap herbs, don't know what the audience thinks, those who went to watch his films.I request this director to make his films carefully from next time.It is better to watch the old Ramayana than this movie where the acting and dialogues are excellent. Direction is excellent. This movie doesn't deserve to be rated 1 star from my side.

How they can change the story which is a great Indian mythology, by just putting disclaimer as ""this is not original Ramayana"", they have no rights to change the original story as their wish. The movie will misguide and wrongly project the Indian culture for the future generations. The movie should be banned immediately and whole movie team should apologize the Hindus.

190,26 June 2023," A Missed Opportunity - Review by Kalyug Briefs
","
Film Review: Adipurush (2023) - A Missed Opportunity - Review by Kalyug BriefsAdipurush, a highly anticipated film based on the epic Ramayana, falls short of expectations, leaving audiences disappointed. Despite the potential to showcase divine miracles and captivate viewers with stunning special effects, the film fails to make maximum use of 3D animation and visual effects, ultimately diluting the grandeur of the Indian epic.One of the main issues with Adipurush is the missed opportunity to fully exploit the rich source material. Ramayana is a treasure trove of extraordinary events and mythical occurrences, which could have been visually spectacular on the big screen. Unfortunately, the film's director seems to have overlooked this aspect, resulting in a lackluster representation of the epic.For those familiar with the Ramayana, either through personal study or as part of their school curriculum, Adipurush may come as a disappointment. The film appears to have made significant changes to the original narrative, altering the essence of the story. This can be disconcerting, especially for younger audiences who are just beginning to explore and understand their cultural heritage. Instead of being a faithful adaptation, the film seems more like a 3D animation ape-man game, filled with excessive fighting scenes that overshadow the depth and philosophical underpinnings of the Ramayana.One glaring issue is the lack of strong and memorable dialogues. It appears that the director either did not have the resources to hire a competent screenplay writer or failed to prioritize the importance of well-crafted dialogue. As a result, the film feels devoid of meaningful conversations and fails to engage the audience on an emotional level. The budget seemingly prioritized cut-and-paste 3D models from other games or sources, further undermining the film's storytelling potential.While Adipurush may boast impressive visuals and a promising premise, it ultimately fails to deliver a compelling cinematic experience. Viewers yearning for a faithful adaptation of the Ramayana will be left disappointed, as the film overlooks the epic's divine miracles and profound teachings. Furthermore, the lack of strong dialogues and excessive focus on action sequences detract from the film's overall impact.In conclusion, Adipurush falls short of its potential to bring the grandeur of the Ramayana to the big screen. The film's missed opportunities, lack of faithful storytelling, and underdeveloped dialogues make it a disappointing experience for both fans of the epic and those seeking an immersive cinematic journey.

First of all Director Om Raut and the entire team should apologize to the people specially hindu sentiment people for making such a mess movie and to change the storyline of Ramayana. And literally you have changed the entire plot. First of all I know nothing about ramayana and I have gone to watch the film. The film is so slow that you'll just bored in start 15-20 mins. There is no fast paced track movie character doesn't have much dialogues they are just walking like a normal people in the entire movie. I mean are you serious you are showing Ramayana and you don't have the vision to show how the lead characters should perform. Prabhas is totally not suited in this role. I don't know what makers have thought to take prabhas as a lead. Then talking about the other cast all are below average except KRITI SANON. She shines in the whole film. Only 2 things I like about this film is KRITI SANON & MUSIC of this film. Rest are just mess and blunder of what Om Raut has created. Director hasn't given her much role but whenever she appears she shines throughout the film. Raavan is a comedian in this film. Whenever he comes on screen you'll just laugh because the saif ali khan character is designed is so funny and doesn't even look scary. Om Raut is so confused in this film he start with the human part but after interval he made an animated film with just cgi characters running and fighting around. It's a headache and I completely fell asleep in the climax because my eyes are so badly paining that I could even watch what's happening next.It's a request to Om Raut please don't do this kinds of experiment with the audience. I know Bhushan kumar has a lot of money but we as a audience don't have enough time to waste in this types of film....

The fable of 'Helen of Troy' gets done within an Indian fantasy world in this very long film. You have a movie that is heavy with CGI and Green screen, and it's not good CGI.The acting and the story is good, some great production design here, music is brilliant and as nearly always, good songs too, just not that many here though. Plenty of action, and use of slow motion is overused, which drags the film on for three hours. A good load of editing is needed, to be sure.The motion capture is used quite a bit in this, too much really, and practical effects would of and should of been used here, so there is a lot of style with no substance, hence the problems. Action is not as great as it should of been.Entertaining as it is, it's flawed and needed polish, but I did enjoy it. Looking at the scores and reviews here, I can understand the disappointment, but I gave it a seven out of ten as it's an different take of 'Troy'. But its' not the epic that it pretends or wants to be. Can say if it's worth seeing, but it beats being bored at home. That's about as fair as I can say.

This is obviously caste-based indoctrination. None of the gods being Brahmans is mentioned in any of the books. Yet these films create a narrative to whitewash Indian history with some brahminical narrative, despite the fact that not a single scripture created before 1200 AD has ever shown a god wearing thread (janeu).The writing is also based on a Ramayana that was penned 400 years ago during the bhakti movement. These filmmakers from the brahmin caste need to have done more research and presented the real Ramayana, which is a component of Indian culture. If they are unable to find it in India, similar tales are followed in other south Asian nations.But I don't believe these filmmakers, who wear thread (janeudhari caste), have anything to do with reality.

The war is at the time of night which is against the basic rules of war in satan history. Ravan's living in a coal mine rather than golden lanka. Ravan is a flesh guy being a brahmin. Also Ram sees sita being kidnapped, totally mocked the whole sense of ramayana. Also an exotic scene with vibhisan and his wife. Ram sita re a bit intimate. Hanuman is just a comedy character. Sushen vaidya is a female and also looks like a hot figure rather than a vaidya. Indrajeet, laxman are totally ruined. Prominent charcters like jamvant, nal nil all are animated and have vanished like other vanars which they depicted as monkeys.It feels that the crew has intentionally ruined the story, divinity, characters, language, theme, simplicity and reality of Ramayana. I sorry, it doesn't feel but it is the reality. This movie needs to be banned and also actions should be taken against whole crew by the society and the law.

Adipurush is a complete disaster of a movie. The VFX is so bad that it looks like it was done by a high school student using outdated software.

What were the creators thinking while shooting the movie...and i don't think the writer has ever read 'RAMAYAN'. Mr. Raut you must watch Ramanad Sagar Ramayan.#prabhas #kritisanon didn't expect this blunder.Misleading the youth of our great nation. Boycott this movie...no proper information , only VFX to make money...and even the cartoons have better animation.The facts shows in the movie are not 100% true..Makes me angry ..had so many expectations from this movie but disheartened to see that directors can do anything to make money.We understand makers have limited time of 3 hours to finish the movie...but atleast show the facts and make it worth watching.#boycott #adipurush.

205,18 June 2023," Adipurush -An Ambitious Mythological Epic That Falls Short
","
""Adipurush"" promised to be an epic retelling of a beloved Indian mythological tale, but unfortunately, it falls short of expectations. The film, directed by Mr om raut boasts an impressive cast and a grand scale production, but it fails to deliver on its potential due to weak dialogues and a lackluster presentation of characters.One of the most disappointing aspects of ""Adipurush"" is its dialogues. The lines lack depth and fail to engage the audience. The script seems to rely heavily on clichés and lacks the poetic or impactful language that one would expect from a mythological epic. The dialogues are often forgettable and fail to create a strong emotional connection with the viewers. This becomes a major drawback, as a good dialogue can elevate the performances and enhance the overall cinematic experience.The way the characters are presented is another letdown. The film revolves around iconic characters from Indian mythology, such as Lord Rama and Ravana, who are meant to have rich and complex personalities. However, the character development feels shallow, and the performances fail to bring out the depth and nuances of these legendary figures. There is a lack of emotional depth and connection in the portrayal of the characters, making it difficult for the audience to truly invest in their journey.Additionally, the pacing of the film is inconsistent. While some scenes are well-executed and keep the audience engaged, there are moments where the narrative drags, and the story loses its momentum. This uneven pacing disrupts the flow of the film, leading to a disjointed viewing experience.However, the technical aspects alone cannot save the film from its weak dialogues and lackluster character presentation. Despite its grand scale and visual appeal, ""Adipurush"" fails to leave a lasting impact.In conclusion, ""Adipurush"" falls short of its potential as a mythological epic. Weak dialogues and a disappointing presentation of characters hinder the film's ability to engage and captivate the audience. While the production design and visual effects are impressive, they alone cannot salvage the film.

This movie sucks at some many levels.Please don't waste your time and money on this pathetic movie. It should be banned all over the world. They shouldn't have made such a movie.

I wish if I could give them negative rating. It's not a new thing to see Bollywood insulting our religion, our history. It's really pathetic to see people calling Ramayana a mythology when it's our precious history. Firstly, Maa Sita does not dress up like the way it is shown in the movie. Shri Hanuman does not look like the way it is shown and there are so many other flaws and wrong story presented in this movie. The dialogues are so stupid that Bollywood never thinks for a second on what they are trying to show. It's so pathetic to see Bollywood always inspiring nonsense from Western culture and producing all pathetic movies which is all about sexual scenes, abusive language and so on and now they try to mess with an inspiring history called Ramayana. All thanks for Ramanand Sagar ji who presented to us a real Ramayana story and this movie is simply an insult. People need to wakeup and take action against Bollywood and completely boycott them.

209,18 June 2023," An Underwhelming Mythological Misfire
","
Adipurush, touted as an epic mythological extravaganza, falls far short of its lofty promises and leaves the audience disappointed. Director Om Raut's ambitious attempt to recreate the timeless tale of Ramayana with a modern twist ultimately proves to be a convoluted mess that fails to live up to its potential.One of the major shortcomings of Adipurush lies in its storytelling. Despite having a rich source material like the Ramayana, the film's narrative feels disjointed and lacks coherence. The screenplay fails to effectively adapt the complex characters and intricate plotlines, resulting in a confusing mishmash of sequences that fails to engage the audience. The film jumps from one event to another without providing a proper foundation or emotional connection, leaving the viewers feeling detached and uninvested in the story.Another glaring issue with Adipurush is its casting choices. While Prabhas, known for his charismatic presence, tries his best to embody the iconic character of Lord Rama, his performance lacks depth and fails to capture the essence of the legendary hero. The supporting cast, including Kriti Sanon as Sita and Saif Ali Khan as Ravana, delivers lackluster performances, further diminishing the film's overall impact. The chemistry between the characters feels forced and lacks the necessary chemistry to make the relationships believable.The visual effects, touted as one of the film's main highlights, are underwhelming at best. While there are a few visually stunning moments, the overall execution feels mediocre and fails to create a sense of awe that one would expect from a mythological epic. The action sequences, though ambitious, suffer from poor choreography and lack the finesse required to make them truly captivating.Adipurush also stumbles in its attempt to present a modern take on the Ramayana. The film incorporates elements of social commentary and attempts to address relevant issues, but the execution feels heavy-handed and lacks subtlety. The message gets lost amidst the chaotic narrative, leaving the audience perplexed and detached from the intended themes.Overall, Adipurush is a disappointing cinematic experience. Its lackluster storytelling, uninspired performances, subpar visual effects, and muddled attempt at modernization make it a forgettable addition to the ever-expanding list of mythological adaptations. While the concept held immense potential, the execution falls flat, leaving audiences longing for a more captivating and faithful retelling of the epic tale of Ramayana.

I recently watched the movie Adipurush, and I must say, I was quite disappointed. The story lacked depth and failed to captivate my interest. The theme seemed disjointed, and the dialogues felt forced and uninspiring. Additionally, the direction left much to be desired, with poor execution of key scenes and an overall lack of coherence. It's disheartening to see such potential go to waste. I had high expectations for this film, but unfortunately, it fell short in several aspects. Overall, I wouldn't recommend Adipurush if you're looking for a compelling storyline, well-developed characters, and skilled direction.

To demean our historic legacy with such amateurish story telling and 80's graphics in 2023 is an insult to the viewing audience!To the writer(s) - get your facts right!1) Ravana was not a Mughal styled ruler! He was a super intelligent leader and got caught in the wrong battle so badly that he had to be embarrassingly defeated after a long battle.2) It is hard to believe that Gods speak Mumbai Hindi like street-side goons!3) Lord Ram has fought many battles like a 14 year exile and fighting to rescue and bring back his better half from a country that was unreachable about 5000 years ago. He did all of this and led his life with great dignity. Prabhas (who was great in Bahubali) portrays him like a domestic political activist that's ready to fight at any provocation. This is just not correct...4) The saddest part in this tirade was Lord Hanuman, who was reduced to a comic rather than the mountain of strength that he is. Over a billion Indians pray to Lord Hanuman at any time when they need some strength from within. The film makers could best depict him as an ape face side-bob with a lacking physique in comparison to any of the other leads, ridiculous!For those that have missed watching this flick and are still eager, please give yourself and your senses some rest and avoid this film like the plague!

One person does something then there's a pause for several seconds before the other guy responds.Gorillas look like cheap copies of the planet of the apes movies. Then there's a bear, that looks like a straight copy from the jungle book.We also have Thor type weapons appearing and disappearing effects.Dialogues are cheap. Colour grading is cheap everything looks fake obviously.

I think they didn't even read Ramayana and started making movie on basis of their assumptions. Ramayana itself is the world's best truth not a story, and the truth should be shown as it was / is. Its a worst movie ever. I mean look at the way how Ramayana tell us about bhagwan Shree Ram and the Ravana and in the movie the truth was vanished.The lanka was made up of gold and they showed us an evil dark place full of bats . Ravan had pushpak vimaan and they showed Ravan flying sitting at the back of a bat , is he a bat man??. They tried to make us fool by showing these Irrelavent things . I am very very disappointed by this movie.

3. VFX is cut copy paste work with some slight changes here and there looks who ever worked on VFX is on cheep thrills

As an avid film enthusiast and a fan of epic mythological tales, I was eagerly awaiting the release of Adipurush with high expectations. Unfortunately, after watching the film, I can't help but feel deeply disappointed and even disgusted by the overall execution. Adipurush falls short on multiple fronts, leaving me with a bitter taste in my mouth. The dialogues are clunky and lack impact, failing to resonate. The unnecessary emphasis on violence and gore feels gratuitous and out of place, tarnishing the moral and ethical teachings at the core of Ramayana. Overall, Adipurush is a messy and disappointing film that fails to do justice to the timeless epic it is based on. It lacks coherence, strong performances, and visual finesse, making it an exhausting and forgettable experience. Save your time and seek out better retellings of the Ramayana story that capture its essence and beauty. Please DO NOT WATCH this movie.

I recently had the unfortunate experience of watching the highly anticipated film, Adipurush, and I must say it was an absolute letdown. The movie promised a grand retelling of a legendary tale, but what unfolded on the screen was a mishmash of bad acting, poor casting choices, and blatant MANIPULATION of sentiments. The film's bad casting choices, poor acting, and the deeply concerning DISREGARD FOR CULTURAL sentiments make it an utterly disappointing experience.However, what truly exacerbates the film's shortcomings is its blatant disregard for cultural sentiments. Adipurush takes a revered mythological tale and distorts it, causing deep offense to those who hold it dear. Instead of treating the source material with respect and sensitivity, the film takes liberties that are not only unnecessary but also disrespectful.By altering the storyline and characters, Adipurush needlessly hurts the sentiments of a significant portion of the audience. It demonstrates a lack of understanding and empathy towards the cultural significance of the narrative it attempts to depict. This insensitivity is both disappointing and deeply concerning. It becomes difficult to invest in a film when it fails to connect with the audience emotionally and remains ignorant of the cultural context it attempts to portray.In conclusion, Adipurush is a deeply unsatisfying film that disappoints on multiple levels. Its bad casting choices and lackluster performances diminish the viewing experience, while its insensitivity towards cultural sentiments further exacerbates the film's flaws. I cannot recommend this film to anyone looking for a meaningful cinematic experience, as it falls short in every regard.

Goes without saying that the CGI is comically worst. Dialogues are super cringy. Acting could have been better. Songs do not even deserve a place in an epic fantasy like this. Prabhas's skin looks like it's been so much digitally toned and perfected that it looks caricaturing. The calmness and composure of Lord Ram is missing by like 100 miles. The casting is bad as well. There were better choices for Ram and Laxman's characters. Overall, the movie is not just bad, it's an insult to the epic Ramayan.

Prabhas was looking like animated body builder and Bajrang was forgetting to keep air in mouth in between scenes. Sometimes Bajrang had swallowed lips and sometimes normal. Om Raut and Bhushan Kumar are selling garbage. Every monkey from Ramanand Sagar's Ramayana did better job than Adipurush's Director/Producer/Actor/Actress/Technician all of them together. VFX is so poor and looks like a paint brush effects. Bollywood should stay away from epic, extravagant, magnificent, history and VFX. This is so bad that I was blaming myself why I wasted my money on this? I should have donated this money to poor people outside railway station and they would have given me blessings which would have been much better than watching Adipurush.

After watching the teaser for Adipurush I knew it's going to be bad, but creator proved me wrong it's worse than that.As Creator said it's a 3D experience, I watched it in 3D still my opinion is same.Only the songs, music and BGM does it's job perfectly. It pumps you at moments.But every other department in this movie sucks.It was very evident that VFX are going to be bad and it delivers exactly that. They used still frames for motion shots many times; the frames were dropping in battle sequences.I still think casting of ""Prabhas"" as lord Ram is wrong. Felt like he is still in Bahubali mode.Kriti done a decent job as Sita, Saif did good as ""Ravan"", other than that nothing works.Biggest failure is the dialogue and screenplay. Just pathetic writing. Lost the essence of purity that lord Ram, Hanuman, Sita had in their language.There are a lot of character and plots were excluded and things they added in story has no heart and felt jarring.Costumes are not authentic, felt very artificial and lack of detailing shows the research done by the team.Fighting sequence from start to end are very average, very poorly choreographed. Battle was staged in dark; it was very hard to see anything. That was done on purpose to hide bad CGI and poor fights. Just nonsense.Last epic battle between good and bad can't get bad than this.Creators are lost and have no understanding of the Ramayana, it's core, it's emotion, it's sanctity, it's importance. No reverence for the Epic.It's a template for ""How to make a disaster"".Don't boycott this movie just forget this happened and watch 1992 Japanese Ramayana instead.

Worst movie in the world.First of all, I have a humble request to all of you not to call Ramayana (Mythology) because it is our history.I can not address Adipurush with any kind of number (I would not give it any rating) because only and only humor has been made in it.There is not a single Ramayana dialogue anywhere in this entire movie.Ravana was a very learned king and he is shown as a Mughal.The most important thing in the war was that Angad's warning dialogue was not the only one which could show the dignity of Purushottam.They made Meghnath (Flash), Honorable, I want to know from you that in which epic you had read that only Laxman ji gets snakebite and for that Lord Hanuman ji went to get Sanjeevani, where was Shakti Baad.If I talk about this whole movie, there is not a single scene in it which defines spirituality.I want to know what thought you guys made this.This movie is fully inspired by Mughals. Not from Ramayana.If you guys think that I am saying wrong then you can discuss me on this I am ready with facts.

I am giving 1 star because it can't get any low than this.Dialouges : Horrible
Screenplay : Horrible
Character's Looks : Horrible (even for bad characters the looks are not justifying)They can't even understand the correct emotion behind Ramayana. Our history is a joke to these propoganda filmmakers as they have not shown a single sliver of respect to our ancestors and our culture.Adipurush the movie fails horribly in every aspect of film making. What I can't seem to understand is after having so many scriptures/puranas/granths , how can they not get the gist of it.Are they that dumb?Maybe not a single person on the Adipurush Movie's team has seen the movie in its entirety before the actual release. That is the only reason they have created such a mind numbing dumb motion picture on one of our greatest ancient treasure.Movies like this should be BANNED and filmmakers like them should be ashamed of themselves. Have some dignity and leave the film business.

ADIPURUSH - A DISAPPOINTING CINEMATIC EXPERIENCEAdipurush, touted as a highly anticipated blockbuster, fails to live up to the hype and expectations surrounding it. From its weak storytelling to questionable casting choices, the film leaves much to be desired. In this review, I will delve into the specific points that contribute to its disappointing nature.LACKLUSTER STORYTELLING:
Adipurush suffers from a lackluster and poorly executed narrative. The storytelling feels disjointed, with significant gaps and underdeveloped character arcs. The plot fails to engage the audience, leaving them disconnected from the events unfolding on the screen. The script lacks depth, relying heavily on clichés and predictable plot twists that do little to surprise or captivate viewers.MISFIT CASTING:
One of the major drawbacks of Adipurush is the misfit casting choices. The film features a star cast that seems more concerned with their stardom than delivering convincing performances. The lead actor fails to embody the character, lacking the necessary depth and emotional range required for such a pivotal role. This miscasting severely impacts the overall viewing experience and hampers the authenticity of the narrative.POOR CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT:
The characters in Adipurush are severely underdeveloped, reducing their impact and making it difficult for the audience to empathize with them. The lack of backstory and motivation for the characters leaves them feeling one-dimensional and unrelatable. The film fails to explore the emotional depth of its characters, resulting in a superficial portrayal that fails to leave a lasting impression.NCONSISTENT VISUAL EFFECTS:
While Adipurush boasts grand visuals, the execution of visual effects leaves much to be desired. The inconsistency in the quality of CGI is jarring and often takes the viewer out of the immersive experience. Some scenes are visually stunning, while others appear amateurish and poorly rendered. This inconsistency undermines the film's overall production value and fails to deliver the visual spectacle expected from a high-budget production.Pacing Issues:
Adipurush suffers from significant pacing issues, resulting in a lack of cohesion and rhythm throughout the film. The narrative jumps between scenes and timelines without proper transitions, making it difficult to follow the story's progression. The pacing often feels rushed, sacrificing crucial moments that could have added depth and emotional resonance to the film.Lack of Originality:
The film falls victim to a lack of originality, relying heavily on tried and tested tropes and formulaic storytelling. Adipurush fails to bring anything fresh or innovative to the table, leaving the audience with a sense of déjà vu. The lack of original ideas and unique storytelling elements further diminishes the overall impact and appeal of the film.Conclusion:
Adipurush, despite its pre-release hype and promising premise, disappoints on multiple fronts. Its weak storytelling, misfit casting choices, poor character development, inconsistent visual effects, pacing issues, and lack of originality all contribute to a lackluster cinematic experience. As a viewer, it is disheartening to witness the potential of a film being squandered due to these fundamental flaws. Adipurush fails to live up to its own aspirations and leaves audiences yearning for a more engaging and compelling cinematic journey.

Our holy book Ramayana, but the film they have made about Lord Shri Ram is very cheap and ridiculous, they have no right to hurt anyone's sentiments so much, they have destroyed our religion. And we didn't expect this from South's hero Prabhas, why after reading this kind of script, after reading this kind of dialogue, no one would be able to change it and he himself would do this kind of work for the greed of money. And such dialogues have been found spoken by our Hanuman in this film, which he would never have spoken. Om Raut and Manoj Muntashir have no right to play with the feelings of people of any one religion.

Just watched the movie. What they have tried to show is absolutely false, this is not the true story of Ramayan. They tried to focus mainly on the war, but while doing that they forgot the most important parts of the actual story. VFX were horrible it looks more like a video game, the characters shown didn't have any impact, horrible acting and portrayal of the characters, the direction is bad and not up to the mark, the language used by the characters and dialogue delivery was a disaster and a disappointment. I don't understand what they were trying to show, please don't show this version of such a great story to your children, it's not true at all.

Worst movie ever. The film creaters made this movie very bad to demolish hindu god Lord sri Ram & Lord . It's clear attack on sanatan dharm . The way they presented maa Sita 👎 Ravaan in chapri look , Bivisan in mordon look, they changed full story & Om Raut wrote his own Ramayan. Where is golden Kingdom Lanka?? The dialogues are very bad feels like chapri pro Max. How this movie passed from sensor board. While watching this movie for a single fraction of time I didn't feel emotion of Ramayan. At same-day in our village Ramleela program was happening & it was far ahead than this movie without any VFX & CGI. Om Raut said to leave one sit for Lord Hanuman ji & it's our turn to respect his decision & leave all the theatre empty for whole Banar sena🐒🐵🙈🙉🙊🦍

First of all don't consider it as the recreation of The Ramayana. Because this movie doesn't have even 1% of the class that Ramanand Sagar's Ramayana has.Worst VFX I have ever seen. The dialogues the actors are delivering it's insult of the story of the Ramayana. The graphic animation is very unrealistic. Bollywood should stop competing with Hollywood in terms of VFX and animation. Don't waste your money on this. There are many good content in which you can invest that money. And the worst part is this movie is making money by the negetive publicity. It's a shame that they made the story of The Ramayana looks like a joke.

Disgraceful. The movie failed in all aspects - acting , direction, script writing, VFX. Should avoid watching the movie especially kid will get a wrong perception about the holy epic ramayana and all the characters. Lord Rama is depicted as an angry young man which is contrary to the original charecter. The Golden Lanka is shown as a castle build in carbon. The constumes look like mediaval greek or arabic constume. Ravan looks like a Sultan from Arab or Afghan. There os hardly any meaningful conversation or dialog. Overall it gives the feeling of Hollywood sci-fi movie told on Arabic background. Save your time and money.. Don't watch the movie.

Audiences are treated to a frustratingly subpar cinematic experience. From cringe-worthy dialogues to underdeveloped characters, this film fails to capture the essence of the beloved epic. Its third-grade VFX and a misleading storyline further contribute to its disappointing overall presentation.One of the most glaring issues with this adaptation is its dialogues. Instead of maintaining the grace and power of the original text, the script falls flat with cringe-worthy lines that do not resonate with the viewer. The lack of depth and meaningful conversations among the characters further undermines the emotional connection that audiences seek.Character strength, a crucial aspect in any adaptation, is sorely lacking in this film. The iconic figures of Ram, Sita, and Hanuman, known for their unwavering determination and inner strength, are portrayed weakly and devoid of their defining qualities. This stripping of character depth robs the narrative of its intended impact and robs the audience of the opportunity to connect with these legendary personas.The visual effects in this adaptation are a letdown, to say the least. With outdated and poorly executed CGI, the film fails to bring the mythical world of Ramayana to life. Instead of immersing the audience in the grandeur and magic of the epic, the lackluster VFX further distances viewers from the intended experience.Adding to the disappointment is the film's misleading storyline. It deviates from the original narrative, leaving audiences confused and disconnected. Instead of staying true to the moral dilemmas and intricate relationships portrayed in Ramayana, this adaptation opts for a shallow and contrived plot that fails to engage or inspire.In conclusion, this adaptation of Ramayana falls short on multiple fronts. The cringe-worthy dialogues, lack of character strength, underwhelming VFX, and misleading story all contribute to a film that fails to capture the heart and soul of the epic. It disappoints both fans of the original text and those seeking a compelling cinematic experience. Sadly, this rendition misses the mark and ultimately leaves audiences feeling unsatisfied.

A few things I disliked about the movie:
1. Very Poorly written script/ dialogues. The writer sounds immature.2. Awful depiction of Ravan and his family members. Wish he had a typical southern traditional look in the movie vs some kind of afghani emperor look. Also, the worst depiction of Lanka.3. The names of characters in the movie. I wish they used the most commonly used names like Sita, Rama, Lakshmana and Anjaneya/ Hanuma. ""Seshu"" felt super weird.4. I wish Janki's outfits were a bit more traditional.5. The action sequences felt like they were taken from a poor game version of the Lord of the rings or something. I don't wanna insult the Lord of the rings. Sorry, fans!6. There were many parts on the movie that didn't make sense. The scenes didn't convey the entire story or the essence of it properly.

I feel sorry for some of the cast. They looked sincere in their efforts. The story, dialogues and overall cartoonish cgi completely destroyed the essence of the movie. If you haven't seen The planet of the apes, Lord of the rings, The Hobbit, Game of thrones, Avengers, Thor and Aquaman then maybe this movie is for you. There are giant bats, orcs, dragons, gargoyles and what not, This should have just been a period film, instead it was turned into a cartoon/video game from 90s when everything was pixelated. Even my old Nokia phone had games with better graphics than this. I gave 2 stars just for Kriti Sanon and Prabhas for doing their best.

Absolute disrespect of the sanatan culture , Prabhas disrespected Bhagwan Ram bhai By potraying him as someone who's always in anger, before potraying shree ram he should have done some research that what is maryada, what is calmness, why is shree Ram called Maryada purushottam. The conversation between Hanuman ji disguised sadhu and laxman was taken from 10 year old whatsapp jokes. Ravan was potrayed as a meat eater with modern hair cut who flew on back of giant bat which was absolute wrong, even tough he was villain there should have been a certain dept to his character like he brahmin and biggest worshipper of Shiva. And worst things about were dialogs here are some examples.Hanuman to indrajeet: ""Kapda tere baap, aag tere baap, to jalegi bhi tere baap ki""
This type vocabulary is used in a so called adaptation of Ramayana.Absolutely dissappointed from hindus who not boycotting this movie.RAMANAND SAGAR'S RAMAYANA WAS THE BEST RAMAYANA EVER MADE, PERIOD!

252,19 June 2023," Adipurush: A Mythological Disaster
","
Adipurush, touted as a grand retelling of a beloved mythological tale, falls short of even the most basic expectations. From casting to makeup, dialogues to visual effects, every aspect of this film is marred by poor execution and a lack of creative vision. It is a clear example of how not to adapt a mythological story for the big screen.One of the glaring issues with Adipurush lies in its casting choices. The actors seem miscast, lacking the charisma and depth necessary to bring these legendary characters to life. Their performances are unconvincing and fail to evoke any emotional connection with the audience. The lackluster makeup only exacerbates the problem, leaving the characters looking artificial and out of place in their own world.The dialogues in Adipurush are cringe-worthy at best. They lack depth, creativity, and any semblance of poetic beauty that is typically associated with mythological storytelling. Instead, the dialogue feels forced and poorly written, leaving the actors struggling to deliver them with conviction. The result is an overall lack of impact in crucial scenes and a disconnection between the audience and the narrative.Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of Adipurush is its visual effects. In an era where groundbreaking CGI and VFX have become the norm, this film falls embarrassingly short. The effects appear amateurish and distractingly artificial, robbing the epic battles of any sense of awe or excitement. It feels like a step back in time rather than a leap forward in cinematic technology.The narrative itself lacks coherence and fails to explore the depth and complexity of the original mythological story it is based on. It feels like a shallow and hastily put together retelling, with key elements missing or diluted. This lack of attention to detail undermines the film's credibility and leaves the audience longing for a more faithful and engaging adaptation.In conclusion, Adipurush is an abysmal movie that fails on multiple fronts. Its poor casting, subpar makeup, cringe-worthy dialogues, and lackluster visual effects make for an unpleasant cinematic experience. It falls short of capturing the essence and grandeur of the mythological story it attempts to retell. Save yourself the disappointment and avoid this misguided and poorly executed film at all costs.

In Adipurush, Saif Ali Khan walked liked as if he had piles.Meghnad moved like Flash and had tattoos like Aquaman all over his body.There was absolute no chemistry between Ram & Laxman, neither between Ram and Lord Hanuman.Characters were not introduced properly as if it was presupposed that everyone knew about them.Some Dialogues were cringe.Many facts were distorted. For example, When Meghnad used Nagpash on Laxman, Garud was called for help. But instead, in the movie Sanjivani buti was used to cure Laxman.So if you are a fan of Ramanand Sagar's Ramayan, don't waste your time and money on this movie as it will ultimately disappoint you in many ways.The only best thing about this movie was its intro with song titled ""Ram Siya Ram"".

In India when a movie is made on the one of the most celebrated God Lord Shri Ram, an excitement of reliving the epic tale is very common. Indian viewers were eagerly waiting for this one.After the backlash on the initial trailer launch which postponed the release of the movie and forced creators to rework on VFX, it was expected that the released version will be much better and will do the justice.Modi government backed lyricist/dialogue writer Manoj Muntashir Shukla and BJP supported Om raut are behind this and their blessings can be seen in start the credits of the movie. But, the outcome was exact opposite of what was assumed.Makers didn't research properly. Costume designs were unimaginable and nowhere near to the characters portrayed in the Hinduism, VFX was not worth Rs 600 crore. Rajamauli can make better VFX based film in the half budget.But, the weakest link of all was the cringe worthy dialogue writing of Manoj Shukla. He portrayed Lord Hamuman like a Bajrang Dal street fighter which is insult to such a great knowledgeable person(Vidyawan, guni, ati chaatur, Ram Kaaj karibe ko aatur).Overall, the team involved in the movie collectively ruined the Epic Mythology of Hinduism and should be avoided at any cost.

Jatau Character is so Chip becouse jatau was gidd raj and in Movie it's Garud. Mata sita Wearing Slive less and Rudraksh mala not found. When rawan was kidnapping sita so she was throwing here golden neckless,ring and other golden aabhushan, ram not like ram, ravan is not like raavan, sita is not like sita and laxman is not like laxman. Hanumaan has Sadak chhap dialogs. Over all movie is like cartoon only.Original ramaayan made by Ramanand Sagar is best movie adipurush is not 10 % of Ramayan.

Prabhas, known for his charismatic screen presence, delivers an extraordinary performance as Lord Ram. His portrayal effortlessly captures the essence of the character, showcasing both his strength as a warrior and his unwavering devotion as a prince. Prabhas's dedication to the role is evident in every scene, making him a perfect fit for the epic tale.Saif Ali Khan's portrayal of the formidable antagonist, Ravana, is an absolute treat to watch. He brings an unmatched intensity to the role, infusing Ravana with a complex mix of power, arrogance, and vulnerability. Saif's nuanced performance elevates the character, making him more than just a typical villain. The confrontations between Prabhas and Saif are electrifying and undoubtedly some of the highlights of the film.Director Om Raut's vision and storytelling prowess shine through in every frame of Adipurush. The grandeur and scale of the production are breathtaking, and the attention to detail in recreating ancient settings is commendable. The visual effects are top-notch, seamlessly blending with the narrative and adding an extra layer of realism to the mythical world. The battle sequences are awe-inspiring, leaving you at the edge of your seat, completely absorbed in the epic clash between good and evil.The supporting cast also deserves praise for their outstanding performances. Kriti Sanon as Sita brings grace and strength to the character, while Sunny Singh as Laxman displays unwavering loyalty and a fiery spirit. They add depth to the narrative, complementing the central characters perfectly.The music and background score by Ajay-Atul are mesmerizing, capturing the essence of the story and enhancing the emotional impact of key moments. The songs are beautifully choreographed, adding to the overall visual splendor of the film.

You can watch this an Animated Movie for Kids but not at all as Ramayan.Dialogues are like written by any Chapri boy who dont have sense of Hindu Mythology and have never rwsd or listened Ramayan.We have read Ramayan and we know the sins of Ravan but we do have respect for him as we know what he was. However in Adipurush Ravan has been portrayed like any Tapori/90's Smugglers.Idiotic Direction.Non sense Screenplay
Costumes Designer was drugged.& Pathetic Dialogues.The mythological movies must go through a validation checklist by the sensor board.The cast has acted ok and followed well the directions but the director himself has lost his all senses and was drugged along with Dialogue Writer.To me its a disaster to hindu culture and hindu Mythology.The production team should be Punished.

Adipurush is epitome of capitalism to try to mint money in name of devotion of billion people of India.I hope soon some regulatory body is created by government to make sure this industry is operated to benefit the culture and creativity and not just converting black money to white , nepotism, exploitation and garbage entertainment adding no value to society.

I gave rating 1 out of 10 for the 3d. The soul of Ramayan is missing in the movie. My parents enjoyed the 3d effects only and asked me to don't waste your money in this kind of movie. My father played the role of Hanuman in his village Ramayan and he was hurt by the language used in the movie.In the name of freedom, they ruined everything in the movie. Every character is a legend but the character building is very worse. Most of the visual ideas took from the Hollywood movies which is a disaster. Golden Lanka became cave of bat. Indrajit became flash ha ha ha. Vanar's became gorrila. Very bad picturization.

It should've got negative review but the minimum is 1 also that 1 is for the songs. All others are bad. The language, the tone, the cinematography and the graphics worst one. The budget and the film is inversely related in this case. The portray of ravana with 10 heads and Hanumana clothes and all. Such disgusting making of epic like Ramayana. And the information shown are also false. Sita Mata was born in Mithila which is current Nepal you can't say it in India. It should be banned in India too like in Nepal.The directors and script writer should check the facts. Still a shame to watch this movie for me.

Evrything portrayed about the characters of Ramayana are absolutely inaccurate. The description of not even one character in adipurush matches with the real Ramayana. This movie is a shame for India and its rich culture. Please ban this movie.The characters are wearing leather belt, leather shoes. In reality they didn't use leather. Rama was in exile
He should dressed like a sanyasi. In movie he was always in war mode, but in reality he dealt very patiently and calmly with ravana and tried to avoid war till last minute.The vpx is very bad. Ravana is portrayed like a vamp , but he was a king, living in a palace of gold, was well dressed . It is a very offending movie to indians.

Do you know what the main problem is? It is not the crappy visual effects or the terrible miscasting; it is the deprivation of heart and soul in the narrative that made things worse for Adipurush.The script is shockingly devoid of any emotional pull, which was indispensable given it is an anecdote that reverberated through centuries, a tale that is revered and known to all, such epics like ""Ramayana"" should have been fostered carefully with foremost sincerity and solemnness; but the creators paid no heeds to such propositions.The religious text or the slew of retellings afterwards have always preserved the core values. In contrast, this 600 Cr. Adaptation failed to summon the same emotionally charged reactions; the senses of divine affection are gone, and surrealism is nowhere to be found, mainly because of the lack of respect shown towards the source material. This was bound to fall down.

I am regretting wasting my time and money on this movie. I wanted to give benefit of doubt and went to watch. Tickets were available at window (my first clue). The movie is not entertaining at all. The story is superficial and does nothing to keep you emotionally involved. The VFX is poor to say the best. Demons look like dementors from Harry Potter and that is in a bad sense. Dialogues are atrocious and use modern day slangs like ""Teri Lanka laga doonga"". Costumes are copied from so many fantasy movies that they further reduce your immersion. Direction is very bad and acting is poor at the best of times. Eventually I could not take it any longer and left during the interval.

They really thought a topic like Ramayan will sell no matter what because people are stupid. Its a lazily made movie. Very clearly the makers have made the least effort possible. They waste so much time on stupid action sequences instead of going deeper into the story.Prabhas looks bored and sleepy. Kriti Sanon is giving the same expressions she gives in all her roles and that Laxman actor looked like he wasn't really told what they were making. Poor Saif tried, but with so much lameness around him, how could he save the movie.I have nothing to do with making movies and I would have still made a better movie than this.

When I decided to watch this film, I had made up my mind to ignore the costume and design changes, and to embrace it with an open mind. But this film, after a decent intro, turned out to be horrible. Adipurush doesn't just fail as an adaptation of the Ramayana, but also simply as a film. Even with a plethora of action sequences, it is nonchalantly executed and feels extremely dull.The VFX, first off, is horrible. I can't believe how the makers were even confident to release this in cinemas. The low quality work renders the film's action sequences unenjoyable, as a result of which they feel dragged and overlong. I'm an action movie fan but this film tested my patience with every passing second. Forget the offensive dialogue, even the simple dialogue fails to evoke any emotion, with the exception of a handful of lines.The film also turns out to be unintentionally funny many times. Lord Hanuman's character is made comedic and aggressive, and the performance by his actor is at times parody-like. For instance, when he is captured in one scene, the way he reacts before falling down is purely hilarious. I feel sad saying this because I worship Lord Hanuman and to see him like this was heartbreaking. Kriti Sanon was a surprise, though. She acted her role sincerely. Sunny Singh had this one weird, choked expression whenever he got attacked or hit. Saif Ali Khan delivered the best performance among the lot, but the weird CGI rendered many of his scenes unbearable to watch.And Prabhas? He ended up disappointing me even though I'm a big fan of him. He emotes with just one expression which is either of worry or rage, and nothing else. The film betrays the source material in many ways, especially with that 1-minute long disclaimer at the beginning explaining all the deal with the cinematic liberties and stuff and how it is not ""necessarily"" an adaptation of Valmiki Ramayana. Ignore that. All of that.Because before the release, its writer claimed the film to be based entirely on the Ramayana we have grown up watching and listening to. No wonder he retracted and later claimed it was not Ramayana. No doubt it isn't, because Ramayana was not a boring CGI fest with zero emotional appeal or connect. Ramayana is not just about a war between good and evil but also a study of the people involved in it. Adipurush piles up one set piece after another, filled with unwatchable VFX, but forgets to add any emotion to it. As a result, I found the film incredibly boring and hard to finish. I had to take multiple breaks, pause it and then resume it: not with the intention to enjoy but to finish it. My excitement died out in the first 45 minutes itself. Rest of the viewing was a mere chore.

Movie Review: Adipursh (Negative)""Adipursh"" is an excruciatingly disappointing film that fails to deliver on its promises and falls flat on every level. From its weak storyline to its lackluster performances, this movie is a prime example of wasted potential.The plot, if one can call it that, is a convoluted mess that lacks coherence and fails to engage the audience. It attempts to blend various genres but ends up being a mishmash of poorly executed ideas. The narrative jumps aimlessly from one scene to another, leaving the viewers bewildered and disconnected from the story.The performances in ""Adipursh"" are equally underwhelming. Despite having a star-studded cast, the actors seem disinterested and their lack of chemistry is painfully evident. Their dialogue delivery is wooden, devoid of emotion, and fails to create any impact. It's disheartening to see talented actors wasted in such a lackluster production.The direction and editing of the film leave much to be desired. The pacing is uneven, with unnecessary scenes dragging on while crucial moments are rushed through. The action sequences, which should have been the highlight, lack intensity and are poorly choreographed. The visual effects are subpar, making the film look dated and unimpressive.

269,13 August 2023," An unimaginative bland retelling of Ramayan.
","
Despite that lengthy disclaimer, it is indeed Ramayan. The story straight away begins with the abduction of Janaki, while quickly narrating why Raghav and Janaki are exiled for 14 years as well as Ravan getting a special wish granted that no God or devil can kill him. Rest is all about Raghav forming a Vanar sena, headed by Sugreeva and Bajrang to fight the battle against Ravan and Co, to safely bring back Janaki.The problem is simple, the vision of Om Raut to re-imagine Ramayan was completely flawed right from the beginning and unoriginally dated. The narrative simply fails to be engaging and much of the scenes painfully look cartoonish throughout. The cheesy lines in an attempt to appeal to the current generation viewers, undermine the scenes in a bad way. The 3hrs ordeal never shows any sign of providing basic entertainment and the terrific Jai Shree Ram song, keeps elevating the dud scenes and one cannot stop wondering, how a song like is wasted in such a film.There is nothing to boast about the performances. Prabhas as Raghav sticks to couple of stock expressions and his interpretation of Raghav doesn't leave a mark. Kriti Sanon as Janaki is decent but gets very little to perform. Saif Ali Khan as Ravan, is honest but the writing simply leaves him with no scope to excel. Ravan is just a regular baddie. Devdatta Nage is good as Bajrang. Sunny Singh as Sesh and Vatsal Seth as Indrajit suffer from one toned characters.I am still baffled on how this film was greenlit. The vision Om Raut had for the visual narrative spelled doom and even if CGI were to be better, it wouldn't have helped the film as those scenes were simply so dull. Hopefully it's a worthy lesson to everyone involved on how not to make a film - mythological or social.

The portrayal of the many characters was so much different that it was way too different than it should have been. Even when teaser and trailers were out & there were lots of reactions. The person from the movie team were so much arrogant that they were not able to accept the mistake they have done. Probably this is the worst way of presenting the history inspired by our mahakavyas.

*ADIPURUSH (2023) Film Review:*Very bad, illogical, senseless, dark, and darkest at times. They call it's based on the Ramayana; but too many mistakes and wrong conceptualizations I observed while watching Adipurush. Prabhas looks flat and graceless (with no smile/charm at all) in the role of Lord Rama, Kriti Sanon doesn't look like Mata Sita and Sunny Singh as Laxman has no weight in the film. Only Saif Ali Khan has given strong performance in the role of Lankesh; but alas he looks like more of a Mughal Emperor than Ravan. So that casting is totally unfitting and to make it further horrible we see cartoon characters as Vali, Sugriva, Angad, Jambavan, Jatayu, etc.No point of getting into the story because it is dark and after interval it becomes darkest. *Mentioning about certain mishaps then...*Lanka is not of gold here, but they have portrayed like it is made up from charcoal.Ravan's vehical is not Pushpak Vimanam, but it's animated and annoying bat.Characters look like a Superheroes of Marvel rather ornamenting mythological.Last 40 minutes just cartoon characters encounter which gives headache to the audience.Whole film is shot in closed space; not a single scene on real locations it seems.Hanuman, Indrajeet and Vibhishana speak indecent dialogues.There's a scene where Lankesh feeds meat to his bat (vehicle) which is a pathetic scene.Throughout Ravan's character looks stonger than Rama; but in the end Rama kills Ravan like a rabbit, in seconds.Romantic song between Ram-Sita.Ravan's snake bath scene.Certain terms are named based on Ramayana and some are not. For example, Laxman Rekha is called Satya Rekha in film.And blunders list goes on...Coming to the cinematic aspects then Direction is very bad, Story/Script has written without examining mythological facts, In the name of Cinematography we see dimness, Babyish VFX and CGI Work, Dialogues are very poor and badly written such that none of the dialogues give goosebumps in this so called epic and the film is longer so should have been cut by 30 minutes (specifically the prolonged last fight).Now coming to the positives then pre-interval it is tolerable. Some of the 3D effects are enjoyable by kids. Ajay-Atul's music is outstanding and 'Jai Shree Ram' song sounds enthralling indeed. Background Score is also good but becomes needlessly loud during climax. Devdatta Nage as Hanuman and Saif Ali Khan as Ravan leave their mark with powerful performances. Overall, I did not like this film though have watched it in 3D; and would rate it as 2/5 (🌟🌟). Simply Avoidable!*What I Liked Most? -* Music and Songs.*P. S. -* If you watch it in 3D then you would sleep well in the theatre because you will have black glasses on and the screen will also be dark most of the time.*BY: NIRAJ SOLANKI..!*

Before going to the good and bad things about this movie I would like to say that om Raut used to be a good director, I really like his movie tanhaji but I don't know what happened to him, this movie is an example of how a movie shouldn't be!. The only thing good in this movie is its background music other than that it's a terrible movie. It's nowhere close to real story and it should be shame without mentioning the cast . Casting is terrible I think they paid Prabhas only for his face, from neck to belong everything is cartoon animation, Saif is god of thunder and batman. He can control both both lightning and bats and the crazy part is there's no pushpakaviman. There are bats there are monkeys there are some kind of bat×dragon creator's some deamons and hell lot of cartoon characters moreover there's flash inspired character and avengers inspired scenes. Can't tolerate this movie. Total rubbish. I think 50% of budget goes to Prabhas for his facial expressions( coz the only thing which is real is his face), he doesn't know how to act he's making his fans fools. I wonder what dedication does his guy have if he can't even make his body good but still need huge remuneration for his ugly work,he should definitely consider quitting his acting career.

Do they really know anything about ramayana, at least watch the serial before making a movie. Really, kisko bithaya tha bhai dialouge likhne!!! Hanuman fans are not going to like this movie. Cast and their languge was not suitable for their role, Lakshman as example!Don't take your child to the movie, they don't need to know all this false story. Location are not true looking, useless VFX, and worst of all dialouges!!Prabhas is good actor but not suitable for role of shree Ram, Kriti is also not suitable, and the lakshman 😂😂😂 need to find proper cast.Really bhai serial hi dekh lete movie banene se pehle ...

600 Cr. Is too much unless Prabhas and other cast took like 500 Cr in fees and they were left with just 100 Cr for music, VFX, promotion, etc.But if they really spent 600 Cr and produced this crappy CGI and effect, either inka popat bana or there is some serious money laundering involved and it must be audited.Like, itna bekar VFX kaiiiiiise ho sakta hai 😄
Coming to movie 🎥 , I will not even go into debate how they totally ""ignored"" the source material ""Ramayan"" or Bollywood is not intellectually capable to make Ramayan for big screen.Let's assume they wanted to make their own ""version"" of it ...then also it had following problems:1. Not much chemistry between Prabhas and Kriti. Yes, I say Prabhas ans Kriti coz they casually acted like themselves only, unlike Raghav and Janaki.2. No consistency in motives and actions and even dialogues of characters
3. Not introducing characters, like for e.g. Angad (just one line about would have been fine though, keeping time constraint).4. That Sonu ke titu ki sweety one as Laxman ji is just wasted on screen.5. To utilise existing characters on screen 📺 in forwarding the story, they made Vibhishan ji's wife the one who tells about Sanjivani booti but why make her character unnecessarily glamorous or titillating.6. Laxman ji asking and Hanuman ji answering WhatsApp jokes was real cringe.The only saving grace are songs and music but we can watch them on YouTube 😁#Adipurush once again proves why Bollywood is intellectually incapable to adapt our nation's ancient historical texts because they try to look at these texts from Hollywood's lens and thus can never be true to the heart and soul of these texts passed down through generations to us.Only one who will let Prem and Bhakti lead the way will be able to retain the essence and adapt these texts beautifully, like how Ramanand Sagar ji did.

Adipurush is the most dissappointing film of 2023 by far.Prabhas looks old in the film and lacks the radiance of Rama. Sunny Singh has little scope and he doesn't really act. He didn't look like the angry young man/ devoted brother which Lakshman was.Kriti Sanon is tthe only one who looks good and acts well. She did well as Sita.Saif as Ravana did his best. But his look and character were totally ruined. In an attempt to make modern adaptation of Ramayan, the makers have created totally different ramayan; a highly dissappointing one.Ravan was a king, why would he do welding himself? And in climax he literally controls an army of bats instead of an army of demons.Indrajit captures Hanuman using a ninja star. No destruction caused by Hanuman in Ashok Vatika, no killing of Akshaykumar, sons of Prahasta, etcVibhishan's wife has an unnecesary bold scene,Indrajit's entire body has tattoo marks and Lakshman stabs him inside water; no fierce battle shown between them.Kumbhakarna suddenly wakes up by himself and goes out to fight; no struggles in waking him up or him trying to make Ravan understand at all.No mention of any other son of Ravana or the rest of demon generals in his army.Ravan's boon was even confused with that of Hiranyakashyap in the film.These are just few of the mistakes.Most of the film is dark and no efforts were made in good vfx or picturisation. Second half was very awkward and wierd to watch in theare.The songs were very nice and some even gave goosebumps.Some scenes, like meeting of Rama and Hanuman, Sita haran and Shabari's meeting with Rama were good to watch.However, I can never recommend this to someone who wants to know Ramayan or has already read the epic.You need to leave your brain at home to watch this but even then you must be ready for some unbearable moments.That's it.

Disrespecting hindu mythological characters which are ideals of Indians. VFX were almost similar to chota bheem cartoon or any other cartoon series. I would have rated this movie in negative stars if there were. Full of nonsense dialogue writing. The makers really thought that they were able to fool people in the name of Ram. Really this movie should be out of the cinemas and should be banned throughout the nations. Do not believe anyone who recommend you this movie and only fools or person having atleast 5 fathers will only recommend you. Definitely a torture, I mistakenly went to the movie but saving you, your time and money by writing this review.

I watched this because I was adamant I would not be a sheep and be put off by the loudest voices criticising the movie... and so glad I watched it. My two kids loved it and are now interested in reading the Ramayan, that alone is a massive tick in the box from me. The effects were great, such a good modern spin on the Ramayan. Didn't bother me in the least bit that it may not have been 100% accurate, what appealed to me was that it was refreshing, enjoyable, and fun for the kids.Do yourself a favour and check it out yourself, don't listen to the big mouths who are bagging the film. It's good!

So bad graphic VFX dialogue.The highly-anticipated mythological epic film Adipurush, directed by Om Raut, was released in theatres on June 16. Starring Prabhas, Kriti Sanon, and Saif Ali Khan, the movie had an impressive start at the box office, earning Rs 140 crore worldwide on its opening day. According to industry tracker Sacnilk, it collected Rs 65 crore on day two of release, across all languages in India. Adipurush is performing well at the Hindi box office as well, with earnings of Rs 37 crore across two days. The second-day gross in the Telugu states for Adipurush reached Rs 26 crore.

Today, I am going to review the movie ""Adhipurush"" with full detail. I will discuss every positive and negative aspect of this movie. So let's start with the positive side, I will share what I personally liked about this movie.Positive - The songs of this movie are really good. They bring peace to the heart when listened to, and the background music is also excellent. It successfully manages to give you goosebumps in certain scenes. Additionally, there are two or three scenes in the movie that look visually stunning. The color grading, cinematography, lighting, and other aspects are all very well done. Speaking of acting, Saif Ali Khan has given a great performance as Ravan in the movie.Negative - Ugh, the whole movie is negative, man. Matlab kya thaa yeh? There are so many mistakes in this movie, I mean, so many that if I start counting them one by one, it will take the whole day. The biggest negative point of this movie is the VFX and CGI they are really bad, beyond terrible. Every single CG character looks fake, not a single one looks real. Even Prabhas as Ram and Saif Ali Khan as Ravan, their body CGI is really bad, you can clearly see on screen how poorly the CG work was done. After CGI and VFX, if there's the biggest problem with this movie, it's the costume design and makeup. Looking at any character, you don't feel like they are from the Ramayana; in the pursuit of giving a modern touch, the filmmakers have made such a bad joke with us. And when it comes to acting, no one has done good acting except for Saif Ali Khan. Prabhas has the same facial expression throughout the entire film. And tell me, who did the casting for this movie? Prabhas as Ram doesn't fit at all. Prabhas looks more like Ravan than Ram. The same goes for Lakshman and Hanuman. In the pursuit of a modern-day adaptation, the makers have completely ruined it. And as for Om Raut, the director of this movie, forget about him. He doesn't even know the basics of direction. The National Award he received for Tanhaji, please take it back. No one could have imagined such a terrible adaptation of the Ramayana, not even in their dreams. The dialogue writer hasn't done a good job either. Some dialogues are alright, but the majority of them are really bad. The director wasted 700 crores. This movie should have never been made, it shouldn't even exist. I feel ashamed to say that this is Indian cinema. It's a stain on the name of movies.I want to give an example. Last year a movie was released called ""Everything Everywhere All at Once."" This movie won an Oscar in 2023, and do you know how many people worked on the VFX and CGI for this movie? Only five people. Just five individuals worked together to create the entire VFX for the movie, and it still won an Oscar. And here you guys failed miserably with a budget of 700 crore. In the eyes of the audience, this will be considered the biggest disaster movie in world history.

The much-anticipated cinematic adaptation of the beloved Indian epic Ramayana, falls miserably short of expectations. The film's execution is plagued by a series of regrettable choices, resulting in a cinematic disaster that fails to honor the source material.One of the most glaring issues with Adipurush is its abysmal dialogue. The lines are poorly written, lacking depth, and failing to capture the essence of the original epic. The film's characters, including the revered Lord Rama, are reduced to caricatures, uttering cringe-worthy lines that do a disservice to the rich and nuanced personalities we know from the Ramayana.Furthermore, the visual effects in Adipurush are downright appalling. In an age where technological advancements have brought us breathtaking spectacles, Adipurush manages to showcase some of the worst VFX work seen in recent memory. The poorly rendered creatures and underwhelming battle sequences detract from any potential excitement or engagement the film could have generated.Perhaps the most disheartening aspect of Adipurush is the filmmakers' apparent disregard for the source material's integrity. By attempting to infuse the ""masala"" movie formula into a revered epic like the Ramayana, they have diluted its essence and tarnished its timeless message. It is a disservice to the countless generations that have held the Ramayana dear to their hearts.Adipurush is a colossal disappointment on all fronts. Its cringe-worthy dialogue, abysmal visual effects, and disrespectful treatment of the epic source material make it a painful watch for any lover of the Ramayana. It is a plea to the filmmakers to stick to what they excel at, rather than attempting to capitalize on treasured stories that deserve a more thoughtful and respectful treatment.Above lines are from Chat GPT and it wrote a way better movie review than the movie itself. A Generative AI version of movie would be much better than this one.

Prepare yourself for an absolute cinematic catastrophe with 'Adipurush.' This film plunges into the depths of abysmal storytelling, appalling acting, and disgraceful execution, leaving audiences in a state of disbelief and utter disappointment. It is an outright insult to the art of filmmaking and a painful experience that should be avoided at all costs.Let's start with the most glaring issue: the storyline. 'Adipurush' takes a classic mythological tale and manages to completely butcher it beyond recognition. The filmmakers seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding of the source material, resulting in a convoluted mess of a plot. It's as if they threw darts at a wall covered in random story elements and decided to mash them together without any regard for coherence or logic. The narrative lacks depth, subtlety, and any semblance of character development, leaving the audience disconnected and bewildered.The acting in this film is nothing short of cringe-worthy. The lead actors stumble through their lines with an embarrassing lack of conviction, making it painfully obvious that they are out of their depth. The performances are wooden and lack any emotional range, leaving viewers wondering how such talentless actors were chosen for these pivotal roles. It's a shame to witness such a waste of potential and a failure to bring life to iconic characters.Moving on to the technical aspects, 'Adipurush' fails on multiple fronts. The visual effects are laughable, resembling low-budget video game graphics from the early 2000s. The poorly rendered CGI ruins any sense of immersion and looks more comical than awe-inspiring. The cinematography is uninspired and lacks any artistic vision, resulting in a visually bland and forgettable experience.The dialogue is another sore spot in this disaster of a film. It is riddled with cringe-inducing lines and clunky exposition, leaving no room for subtlety or nuance. The writing feels lazy and uninspired, relying on tired tropes and clichés that have been seen a thousand times before. The attempts at humor fall flat, further highlighting the film's overall lack of wit or originality.To make matters worse, the pacing of 'Adipurush' is utterly atrocious. It drags on at a glacial pace, with scenes that overstay their welcome and offer little to no narrative progression. Conversely, crucial moments are rushed through without allowing the audience to fully grasp or appreciate their significance. The inconsistent pacing only serves to amplify the film's lack of focus and direction.In conclusion, 'Adipurush' is a colossal failure in every conceivable aspect. From its butchered storyline and abysmal acting to its laughable visual effects and uninspired dialogue, it is a prime example of how not to make a film. Save yourself the agony and avoid this travesty of cinema. It is an insult to both the audience's intelligence and the rich mythology it shamelessly exploits.

The adaptation of the epic saga, Ramayan, falls short of expectations due to its inept and lackluster execution. The portrayal of characters by the actors fails to capture the essence of the original story, leaving the audience disconnected. One of the most glaring issues lies in the dialogue writing, which is not only subpar but also lacks the depth and gravitas required for such a profound narrative.The film's downfall could have been avoided if it had embraced simplicity, focusing on the core values and teachings that the Ramayan imparts. A more restrained and authentic approach to storytelling would have undoubtedly garnered greater appreciation from the audience.The utilization of animation and visual effects in the movie is a source of unintended amusement rather than awe. The laughable quality of the effects makes it difficult for viewers to immerse themselves in the narrative, as the on-screen visuals are often jarring and out of sync with the intended atmosphere.In hindsight, it's apparent that this project was driven more by commercial interests than a genuine desire to do justice to the cultural and emotional significance of the Ramayan. The film seems to have been rushed with the sole purpose of capitalizing on its potential to generate revenue, disregarding the sentiments of the billions of Indians who hold the story in high regard.In conclusion, the botched adaptation of the Ramayan serves as a reminder that faithful storytelling, meticulous character portrayal, and a sincere understanding of the source material are crucial when attempting to bring such revered narratives to the silver screen. This unfortunate endeavor missed the mark by a wide margin, leaving audiences disappointed and questioning the intentions behind its creation.

I just finished watching the movie, and I'm honestly baffled by the sheer lack of effort put into it. Makers played with our emotions. It's clear that the makers of this film were more interested in a quick cash grab than in creating a meaningful experience. The performances were lackluster at best, and I couldn't help but feel sorry for the talented actors who were dragged into this mess.The special effects were downright laughable, as if they were pulled straight from a 90s B-movie. It's as if the production team didn't even bother to do their research or invest in modern technology.What truly irks me is the disrespect shown to the audience. It's almost insulting how the filmmakers seemingly believed that they could slap together any random scenes and call it a movie. As a viewer, I deserve better than this lazy attempt at entertainment. It's disheartening to see creators take such a half-hearted approach to their craft, especially when there are countless talented individuals out there who would kill for the opportunity to bring their visions to life.In the end, this movie serves as a reminder of the importance of genuine dedication and respect for the art of filmmaking. The makers of this film should indeed feel ashamed of their work, not only for wasting their own potential but for letting down anyone who had the misfortune of watching their creation. It's a true shame that this film will be forever associated with a missed opportunity to create something truly remarkable.Huge disappointment.

I thought the bad reviews were a hype, but watched it on Netflix today and it's really horribly made. Ramayana is a household story and you must not miss out crucial details or twist facts - what makes the story fun some details like Bali and Sugriv's fight and showing that Bali was in fact an even bigger fighter than Raavan, Hanuman passing through the hurdles when crossing over to Lanka and making a chair out of his tail when not offered a seat, Angad putting his foot down etcI think where they went wrong is trying to squeeze a big story in 3 hours and ending up missing out on crucial details. They got completely lost in what to show and what to skip. Ramayana can beat all superhero movies if made properly. It must be made in 3-4 chapters and each can be 3 hour long. Nothing more needs to be said.

I would rather spend 3 hours watching a log of wood than this. Changing each scene, each dilog and the story itself and calling it historical is mockery. All the actors, writers, producers, directors and anyone and everyone connected with the film should retire immediately and start there journey as circus clowns rather than this. This movie s**ks in each department.They call it story of Ram and Sita and then they use dialogs which are pedestrian even for today. Do u think Lord Hanuman who is the living symbol of the word ""Humble"" would arrogantly call ""tere Baapka"". Mr. Mutashir or whosoever he is must surgically seal his lips and amputate his fingers.

Even Salman Khan movie like KKBKKj is better than this as at least we know what's coming up and expect. Go back and watch Epic Ramayan serial and wash away your Sin.

He is the culprit behind this disaster. This is the worst movie of all times. They tried to do the VFX bit failed miserably. I am not sure what did netflix think before taking this movie on their platform. We have grown up hearing ramayan and watching ramayan but this ramayan is not the mythological ramayan which we knew. This is something totally new. I understand they tried to fit a lot in 3 hr movie, but who forced you to do all in one? You could have made 2 parts and launched it with good content. Direction is really bad and the dialogs are the worst of all times. No one will like these dialogs especially when they are related to beliefs and mythology.

As an avid moviegoer who appreciates diverse storytelling, it is disheartening to encounter a film that not only lacks creativity but also displays a blatant disregard for religious sentiments. Unfortunately, adipurush falls into this category, presenting a portrayal of God that is both cartoonish and disrespectful.From the outset, it becomes apparent that the filmmakers have chosen to approach the divine with a complete lack of sensitivity. Instead of recognizing the profound significance that religious beliefs hold for countless individuals, the movie reduces God to a mere caricature, stripping away the reverence and awe that should be associated with such a sacred figure.The script and dialogue do nothing to rectify this misstep. Instead of offering thoughtful insights or engaging philosophical discussions, the movie opts for shallow humor and cheap gags at the expense of religious followers. This approach not only demonstrates a lack of artistic integrity but also serves to alienate and hurt those who hold their faith dear.While artistic freedom should be celebrated, it is imperative to strike a balance between creative expression and respect for religious beliefs. Regrettably, adipurush fails to recognize this responsibility, resulting in a production that leaves a bitter taste in the mouths of its viewers. It is an unfortunate reminder of the consequences that arise when artistic liberties are taken without considering the impact on people's sentiments.In conclusion, I cannot recommend adipurush to anyone seeking a film that treats religious themes with respect and sensitivity. Its cartoonish depiction of God and the accompanying disregard for religious sentiments undermine any potential for meaningful exploration of faith. It is my hope that filmmakers will learn from this misstep and approach religious themes in the future with the consideration they deserve.

","
If any Mythological adaption will be produced or directed by Bollywodians ,then please stay away and avoid the movies as this 1 of the buring example of the Drastic and pathetic Movie.Prabhu SHREERAM is the sign of love ,culture, dignity and Peace.But in this movie he has only portrayed as the warrior which is completely False.As per Ramcharitmanas both Hanuman ans Shreeeram's character, nature ,looks has been contaminated.LORD HANUMAN never used slow grade words showed third class attitude to any one which had bee. Showed in this movie.What will be the impact up on the upcoming generation who will watch this movie.Bollywod has become the gang of chapris and double standards morons.

304,19 June 2023," Worst side of presenting ramayan
","
Adipursh is one of the worst movie i have seen. Om raut just wasted 500 crores Making cartoon movie with great star cast. Ravan character made comedy in this movie. VFX is the worst.I couldn't believe why they would release such kind of a product. If the young minds of today get their understanding of Valmiki Ramayana from this movie then I don't know what will happen in near future.If this will be their Raavan then i don't know what exactly will they think of Ramayana in the first place. Absolutely lack luster VFX isn't the only problem with this film. Rather VFX is much less of a problem in this movie. The main flaw is in this representation that has been made by the makers. Raavan has an attire of an islamic dictator. He has been shown wearing a t-shirt along with leather straps over him with spiky hairstyle and rather non-sense get up. He is shown riding a bat but there is no mention of why he is riding a bat, is that pushpak vimaan or what. Characters around him are just goofy men or rather cartoons in his army who behave like lord of the rings character. Indrajit is shown as a guy having powers of Flash and attire of Connor McGregor. I can't imagine this being Ramayana.

Take this movie off OTT platforms.. the worst movie one can made.. even my 5 year old kid knows the ramayan story and he is disappeared with this movie.You can not attempt in such a worse way, if you really wanted to squeeze the movie in 3 hours then instead of songs you should have shown the real history n story. Raven was a Hindu and biggest Shankar devotee, he was not the a third class person that is shown in movie. Common atleast think about what you are trying to show.. If you wanted to make Hindi avenger types of movie then you should have been inspired by story and make it with different characters but this is insult of Hinduism, it's history and also insult for Ravan.

This is by far the worst film that Bollywood can produce. A film on our great epic and history Ramayan needs a lot of responsible writing and the writers have terribly failed.The costume design was pathetic and shows how shallow the research was. Things shown in the film is utter disrespect to Hindus who revere Lord Ram and Lord Hanuman ji as our superheroes.The set design and VFX was below average and it seems the producer only spent the money for PR.The makers didn't realise the sanctity of the dialogue between Lord Ram and Ravan.Albeit being arch rivals both of them shared great amount of respect for each other and it was completely missing in the film.

The movie is an unbearable watch.

One of the worst movies of recent times that banks on people of faith and is a silly excuse of a devotion movie!There are numerous cringe dialogue, inaccuracies in the power of the Gods present, inaccuracies in the war that happened, forced nudity, etc.It disappoints the viewer at so many levels!

Hey everyone,
Seriously this movie made me feel disappointed. This movie disrespected our gods and culture.Use of vulgar language is not at all tolerable. Apart from that, use of VFX is also not acceptable. Some movie scenes offended me.Waste of Rs. 600 crore.Our old serial was way too better than this. They had so less budget, yet they made a masterpiece.After hearing the background music and songs of the movie, I felt so good. But the movie was way too disappointing. I wish I could watch movies on such topics which are really nice in the future. If I knew that this movie would be this terrible, I would not wasted my money to watch this movie in the theatre.

Roadside people can make better VFX and dialogues and acting than Om Raut and Manoj Munteshar. Very bad acting and One of the low catagory dialogues. You guys can not even copy of Ramanand Sagar Ramayan. Hollywood makes science base movie while bollywood makes hurting sentiments of people from where you they are earning.

I am not going into inaccuracies and misrepresentations of Ramayana, lots been said about it. However, another thing that was really annoying was the poor effort to create character visualizations without putting any effort or originality.All characters seemed to be a poor and utterly funny rip-off of Hollywood superheroes:Ravana is depicted like Thanos, complete with larger than life heightIndrajeet is a mix between Aquaman and Flash. He has tatoos, swims at blinding speed and runs like FlashVanar sena is a rip off of Planet of Apes characterEven Lanka has been made to look like a darker version of AsgardWe have so much creativity and originality in our epics, if the producers would have made some effort. Even if they had to copy, they might have tried to intelligently copy as opposed to making it comical.Complete waste of time.

Its just sad to see so much money and effort being wasted. The makers made no effort to make anything make any sense. They just felt it's a religion based movie so people will make it a hit. We do not live in that day and age any more. Makers are held accountable for their actions and it seems most of the audience is disgusted by this adaptation. Adapting any story into a modern form is a art and is always welcomed. Just try and make some sense out of it. Zero introduction to any characters. Zero relevance to any of the scriptures or characters its supposed to be based on. This a just a cashgrab on peoples sentiments.

314,25 July 2023," Adipurush - A Frustrating Mess
","
Adipurush left me utterly disappointed and frustrated with its abysmal visual effects and nonsensical storyline. This movie had the potential to be an epic trilogy, but instead, it turned out to be nothing more than a trashy attempt at cashing in on a popular mythological tale.One of the most glaring issues that plagued Adipurush was its shockingly bad visual effects. It felt like the filmmakers hired amateurs instead of seasoned professionals to handle the VFX. Even a ninth standard student could have produced better visual effects than what was presented in this film. The shoddy CGI detracted from the overall viewing experience, making it difficult to immerse oneself in the story.The screenplay was equally disappointing, lacking coherence and failing to weave a compelling narrative. Scenes felt disjointed, leaving the audience bewildered and struggling to piece together the story. The lack of depth in character development made it challenging to connect with the protagonists, further dampening any interest in the plot.The costume design was absurd and, at times, laughable. It seemed as though the designers took inspiration from a fancy dress party rather than capturing the essence of ancient mythology. This lack of authenticity only added to the overall disappointment.The casting was a major letdown as well. The actors failed to bring life to their characters, and their performances felt forced and unconvincing. It was a missed opportunity to showcase the talents of capable actors who could have elevated the movie with their performances.What frustrated me the most was the blatant misuse of Hanuman's character with abusive dialogues. This felt disrespectful and out of place in a mythological tale that is meant to inspire and teach moral values.Furthermore, it was evident that the filmmakers lacked a deep understanding of the Ramayana. Instead of delivering a fresh and engaging adaptation, Adipurush copied elements from various sources, such as Avengers, Harry Potter, and Game of Thrones, making it feel like a mishmash of unrelated themes. The portrayal of Lanka resembling Asgard on dark mode was particularly absurd and disconnected from the essence of the Ramayana.In all honesty, there is nothing that I liked about Adipurush. It was an excruciating experience to sit through this film and witness the butchering of a beloved mythology. My sentiments are hurt by this poorly executed movie, and I urge others to save their time and watch Ramanand Sagar's 90s Ramayana instead, which remains a timeless and superior retelling of this epic tale.

Trash - Ramayana, Bhagavatha, Mahabarath are not mythological stories but they are our history n pride. In the name of westernisation or improvisation or direction liberties please do not spoil the soul of our history. For example Lakshmana knows about his brother in and out and never question Rama n his values but in this movie you will see lakshmana doing that. It was Sushena who told to bring sanjeeva but not Sarama(Vibhishana's wife - who actually stayed in Ravana Lanka when her husband was with Lord Rama) and many more. You may ask or question me about recent English adaptions of the epic by Amish Tripati, Anand Neelakantan and Devdutt Patnaik but they did not spoil the soul but the way of telling Ramayana in different person view for example Asura was telling Ramayana from Ravana's Angle. So I here I do not want to talk much about story as everyone have minimum knowledge of Ramayan. So, coming to technicalities Om Raut might be a worshiper of 300 movie because you won't see much light in the movie and everything happens in grey / dark shades(one should remember in Tretayug dharma with four padas and battle happens in morning only though Ravana was rakshas), very poor vfx, heroic elevation which are not required for this story, Poor lighting, Poor Costume only positive is BGM. There is so much scope for emotions in Ramayana but Om Raut changes in stories( Sita maata apaharan episode(you don't believe it happened in front of Rama according to OM Raut), Jatayu episode, Sabari episode, Vali episode, Rama setu episode and much more) sorry again diverted into story - couldn't help it. So it's a trash in the name of Ramayana. I really don't care who played character Rama but I care about how the Ramayana was narrated.

In 1980s technology also ramanand sagar made such a masterpiece and with so many technological development these makers have created such a useless piece of art.

Poor changes in actual Ramayana story that wasn't required actually, but too spoil, too much fiction useB grade VFX, the movie showed Ram striking arrow from a distant place on Bali and 2nd time on Ravan while they were busy fighting with someone else. Actually seems against war ethics.The Ravan's Bat was a epic disappointment to viewers, Ravan's Palace was too a more of star wars ship than a kings palace, and no Gold seen in then golden palace extremely poor work on scenes and dressups, entire ravan's forces where again a failure as in case of ravan.And we never expected a Flash character i ramayana, guess who it can be ???Overall a bad depiction of story with irrelevant changes.Lakshman looked ever ready to strike and kill some even small stuffs weather its for the demons in first instance or for poor shabri mata which he presumed to be a enemy and ready to shoot arrow at and dialogues like when lakshman low standard comments on sugreev while he battles to bali.Big bat was not required at all, was a spoilerAlso movie showed that Hanuman was now aware or confident of his capabilities like flying, strength unless encouraged on guided by someone in team.Not a movie worth 2 stars as it mis-presented the characters but even spoiled a good existing story.

This move is not based on Ramayan this is a joke that the director and producer have created. Don't make movies if you don't have unique ideas and if you are using our history then show it properly. Respect the culture and stop using trash Bollywood dialogues in movies like these. From start to finish, it is a complete letdown. The storyline is weak and lacks any originality. It's just a rehashed version of countless other mythological films, offering nothing new or exciting. The acting is subpar, with the actors delivering their lines in a monotone and uninspired manner. The special effects are laughable and look like they were created on a shoestring budget. The fight sequences are poorly choreographed, lacking any real intensity or thrill. Overall, ""Adipurush"" is a forgettable and underwhelming film that fails to live up to its hype.

Just one day prior to watching this movie, I was narrating the story of Raam, Sita, Lakhsman & Rawaan. The next day when I turned on my netflx I got recommendation for this movie. (I am a big fan of Raam & his story by the way and I had Hindu friends who would narrate me the story every now and then during my school days)So I sat with my kids and watched the movie, first of all the VFX was totally childish (My kids and I were comparing it to Bahubali, which is an epic). Secondly there was no proper character introduction to any of the characters and the story starts off from the middle. Rather than how Raam got married to Sita while he shot the arrow in the fish's eye.Anyways, both the side of Raam and Rawaan were totally different. Raam's side was rather backwards vs Rawaan's side was ultra modern except for the giant bat that he rides. Rawaan's 10 faces looked like a child had done the VFX. And I can go on and on and on.My kids got a grasp of what I narrated to them one day back. But I am totally disappointed by the overall movie. It could have been made a thousand times more better that what it is.

It is with deep disappointment and a sense of outrage that I write this review for the movie ""Adipurush"" This film not only fails as a piece of entertainment but also shamelessly disrespects the sacred epic of Hinduism ""Ramayan"" .From the very beginning, it becomes apparent that the filmmakers have no regard for the rich cultural heritage and profound spiritual beliefs of Hinduism. Instead of presenting a thoughtful and respectful portrayal of Hindu practices, they resort to shallow stereotypes, distortion of facts, and a blatant disregard for accuracy.The movie shamelessly appropriates Hindu rituals and symbols without any understanding or reverence for their true meaning. These aspects, which hold immense importance to millions of people, are reduced to mere caricatures and cheap gags, ultimately serving no purpose other than to mock and belittle a deeply cherished faith.Moreover, the film's storyline is riddled with inaccuracies and misinterpretations of Hindu mythology and history. It presents a skewed and distorted version of Hindu deities and their stories, further adding insult to injury. The careless and irresponsible handling of these sacred narratives only serves to perpetuate ignorance and misconceptions about Hinduism among viewers who may not have a deeper understanding of the religion.Filmmakers have a responsibility to exercise cultural sensitivity and ensure that their work does not harm or offend any religious or cultural group. Unfortunately, ""Adipurush"" fails miserably in this regard. It is a clear example of how commercial interests and shock value have taken precedence over basic decency and respect for religious sentiments.I strongly advise individuals who hold Hindu beliefs dear to avoid watching this movie. By doing so, we can send a powerful message to the film industry that such careless and offensive depictions of religious practices and beliefs are unacceptable. Let us stand together against the denigration of any religion and demand responsible filmmaking that promotes understanding and respect for all faiths.

Please stop creating movie. What kind of language you use in a film which is based on a religious and hindu god. You have got a lesson from people who have rejected the film right away. Jai Shri Ram.

In this movie actress is disgusting and In this movie the role of ram doing prabhas its doing very worst level.And what to say about dialogue, the used dialogue was totally pathetic 😭 which can't be used for ramayan characters.There should be less than 0 rating for such a bad movie, there is a huge difference between Ramayana and Adipurush movie. This movie has done the work of defaming the history of India and the history of Maryada Purushottam Shri Ram, people are watching the movie only to see Prabhas, otherwise a good movie cannot be made in favor of Hinduism from Bollywood everyone knows. None of the cast and crew of Adipurush would have read Ramayana, this is just the irony of Ramayana, it is a request to all Hindus, please do not watch this movie because through this movie, they want to tell a different history to the new generation.I am giving 1/10 stars.

I can't believe how can Manoj Mutashir write such dialogues. I mean a person whose writing is so well celebrated, how can he write such unserious dialogue? If we want a depiction of Ramayana at least it should have well-respected dialogues. It seems as if the writer was suggested not to write good dialogue and make the film a flop.The Ravana's heads were divided into two parts one line contains 5 heads and the other line contains the rest... that was epic. None of the other characters except ShreeRam, Hanuman, and Ravana from the Ramayana were celebrated enough to make the viewers understand their importance.It is so badly written and directed that when you search on youtube for the ""Spoof of Ramayana"", the first answer is Adipurush. I think now the genre of the film should be changed to comedy.

Corns of the movie:worst dialogues (example - 'lanka laga denge teri')
bad vfx
bad cgi
no sincerityThey think 'ek song release krke aur hanuman ji ke liye seat book krke log inki wahiyat movie dekhne aaenge..'
You can't even expect the movie to be that bad, its a 500 crore + budget movie.""Its the biggest disappointment to indian youth and indian cinema.""Prabhas showed no resemblance to god sri ram, he was in a fighing mood in the whole movie. You can't find him smiling or talking without anger to anybody in the movie. Ravan is shows to be the vilian of some hollywood movie, they mixed all hollywood movies together.

I'm not saying ""worst"" to the storyline , i respect my religion alot and bhagwan shree ram , ""worst"" is a phrase for the movie they've created, I don't know why?? Whyyyy they've created this big mess. Just to get money they've stooped to this level, it's shameful.The use of language in this movie is ""worst"" , the character's costume choices are ""bad"" , and you know what's wrong with it?? They've changed alot of scenes from the history, dude. Comeon, don't ruin the history man. There are alot of bad movie stories , fix them, not our history. It's ridiculous. Insult to hinduism and bhagwan shree ram and family.

Our Ramayan is not just our feelings its within us .. it's culture,moral, truthfulness, and devotion is within us. But the way actors portrayed their role representating our Lords is never be accepted ... Because the way of saying and mindset of revenge is never in Satyug.. and especially my Lord Hanuman ji , role is very worst played and hanuman is the idol of devotion and respectful. But here it's different... This film is teaching wrong to our upcoming generation...this shouldn't happen. Don't watch😡 dont support.🤐. Stop copying... Dilougues from gurus..(lanka dahan dilougue) and copied ok but representing in such aggressive way is never should be done...😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡

Nothing is relatable. Not even close to any Ramayana let alone ramanand sagar's ramayana. And infact the Film people blame audiences for bad taste of film rather than accepting that the film was utter disaster and had lots of flaws. Go watch Shan's Prasher's review for the details ok disaster. The dialogues are c-grade, Ram depiction portrays the personality of Ravan unlike the personality the Ram, who is usually the calm, smiling, confident and yet humble (remember Ramanand Sagar's Ram). The film PR has made lots of stupid publicity stunts like leaving a seat in the theatres to spread that Hanuman wil come to watch the movie. It shows that they think audience will accept anything if you give a religious angle to it.

Whoever chose the cast did an absolute injutice to the movie,prabhas is the worst possible choice for lord Ram,no expresions, they tried very hard to distort the facts throughout the movie, Ravana is shown as meat eater and in completely opposite manner,even Lord Hanuman is shown in bad light, funny character using slangs as a way to communicate throughout the film, the director and writer should be ashamed of themselves for playing with the religious sentiments of the majority in India. This film needs to be banned.

Even Though the story has been based on the real ramayan, there are many wrongs in the story. Ravan has been potrayed as pure evil along with his Lanka. The Lanka was to be made of gold arther than black and why is everyone wearing black. The VFX are just the worst and even a PS4 game can do better. I have wasted three hours of my life and I want that you don't, so please don't watch that movie instead watch the real ramayan, the one on durdanshan. Hanuman ji has been made so sill and rather should've been made more strong and more realistic, he just seems like another human holding air in its mouth. Ravan has also been made silly. I sincerely request that you don't watch the movie and make it flop very badly.

Writer & director should go and learn Ramayan first. What a waste movie & waste of time/movie. Adipurusha left me thoroughly disappointed. The movie not only failed to capture the essence of the Ramayana but also had subpar visuals. Additionally, it was disheartening to discover that many scenes and dialogues seemed to be directly lifted from another film. The lack of originality and attention to detail further diminished the overall experience. Future adaptations should prioritize authenticity, compelling storytelling, and visual quality to deliver a satisfying cinematic journey that honors the source material.

Now that you have started reading due to such a high rating hear me out.I watched it knowing that it is an adaptation.I will tell the problems first. I watched it on OTT and the animation is pretty bad at some points in the movie. Sometimes the way arrow was held or generally the forests. Some dialogues felt weird at points but most of them were good and impactful.The good part? Yes, there is. The background music is good. Most of the dialogues were good. The way Raghav motivated vanar Sena for war made me teary. You need to watch them to feel the impact. In general the scenes where weapons are used mostly appeared nice.I became an atheist from a Hindu. I liked that finally we could watch Ramayan in a fun manner, learning it's values. Not just as a religious thing.If you are not watching seeing the reviews then please don't do that. This is surely worth a watch.I actually felt how good Ram was and I should try to be as much as I could like him at the end of the movie.

This movie is disastrous disappointing and disheartening. Om Raut is cult non sense guy. How can he make a mock and joke out of this. Nothing is interesting in the movie. What are these appearances, why do Lankesh has A vampire (bat) as his vehicle when we all know that Sita was captured in Pushpak Vimaan, Why Raghav is wearing leather belts? Why Shesh always will stand behind Raghav and give negative reviews to him on any situation? Why Bajrang has a 3rd class dialogue delivery with Indrajeet? Why Sugreev, Angad and all did not get the Bajrang like appearances? Why Indrajeet look like Tattoo artist from South Goa ? Why Ravan's 9 heads are like some book's arranged in a shelf and Why god why? Why did i watch this movie? Lord Shri Ram and Hanumanji, please forgive me for watching this movie. Hope Om Raut stops making movies. One smart move that you changed names for all characters and you can later claim its your version of Ramayan and its inspired not remake. Sahi hai. HONESTLY FOLKS, please DON'T waste your money. Biggest torture was i watched it on my birthday yesterday.

A big no to this movie..nothing to do with the Ramayana. This movie is all about Chapri dialogues. I think the only reason for this movie to fall in a big budget cinema is because of the money charged by actors.I don't blame bollywod for creating this garbage, as they are not doing anything new. 95% of movies coming from bollywood is garbage, and of the rest 5%, most are copy of fine hollywood movies. I wonder why there is no item song in this movie(sarcasm).For those who are interested in experiencing Ramayana... please go and watch ""Ramayana: The Legend of Prince Rama"" directed by Japanese director Koichi Sasaki and Yugo Sako, assisted by Ram Mohan.

342,18 August 2023," Aadipurush Movie Review - A Big Letdown
","
Aadipurush is a 2023 Indian movie based on a famous story called Ramayana. The film is about action and magic, but sadly, it turns out to be a big disappointment. The director, Om Raut, tried to make something great, but it didn't work out. The movie has lots of money spent on it, so it looks nice, but even that can't hide the problems. Prabhas, who is a good actor, is in the movie, but the story doesn't let him show his talent. Saif Ali Khan plays the bad guy, but his character is not interesting.The exciting fights in the movie should be fun, but they are not. They are boring and don't make you feel excited. The computer-made special effects also look fake and not real. The actors Kriti Sanon, Sunny Singh, and Devdutta Nage also don't do a good job. It's not their fault entirely; the story they have to act in is not good. The movie is in two languages, Hindi and Telugu, but this makes things worse. Sometimes, the talking and the actions don't match, and it's hard to feel connected to the story. Aadipurush tries to be a new version of the old story, but it forgets what made the story special. It cares more about looking cool than telling a good story. This is a problem because the original story is about important things like feelings and lessons.To sum up, Aadipurush is a big disappointment. Even though it looks nice and has famous actors, it doesn't tell a good story. The fights are not fun, the acting is not great, and it forgets what made the old story special. It's a lesson in how not to make a good movie.

That movie , man how can they play with our sentiments in such way??!! . From which aspect it looks like a 600 crore budget movie man.... that chapri style Hanuman. And leave about ravan is he even a ravan . It looks like the ravan spends all his time in the saloon . The ravan wears a t shirt and has a boy cut with blade hair cut . And that indrajeet he looked no less than an African. Don't you dare to go to the lanka like since our childhood we all have heard that "" Ravan ki sone ki Lanka thi "" and here they have build an Asgard Lanka . This movie has kingkongs , thanos , even Avenger characters and what not . Specially that scene in which ravan wears a helmet and was forging a sword like a swordsmith .

Where do I even begin with Adipurush? This movie, touted as a magnum opus, turned out to be a colossal disappointment, failing to deliver on every front. From its shallow storytelling to its cringe-worthy performances, it's hard to find any redeeming qualities in this cinematic disaster.Let's start with the narrative, or lack thereof. Adipurush takes a classic mythological tale and somehow manages to strip it of all depth and substance. The screenplay is convoluted and poorly executed, leaving the audience confused and disconnected from the story. The characters are one-dimensional, devoid of any real emotions or motivations, making it impossible to invest in their journey. It feels as though the writers threw together a mishmash of scenes without any consideration for coherence or logical progression.To make matters worse, the performances in Adipurush are abysmal. Prabhas, who has proven his acting prowess in previous films, delivers a lackluster performance as Lord Ram. His portrayal lacks charisma and fails to capture the essence of the character. Saif Ali Khan, as the antagonist Ravana, hams it up to the point of absurdity, delivering cringe-worthy dialogues and over-the-top expressions. The supporting cast does nothing to salvage the film either, with forgettable performances that add no value to the viewing experience.The visual effects in Adipurush are a mixed bag. While some sequences are visually stunning and showcase the potential of modern technology, others fall flat and appear cartoonish. The inconsistency is jarring and only further detracts from any sense of immersion in the story. The action sequences, which should have been the film's saving grace, lack impact and fail to evoke any excitement or awe.Additionally, the editing of Adipurush leaves much to be desired. The pacing is uneven, with sluggish moments that drag on and abrupt cuts that disrupt the flow of the narrative. It's clear that the filmmakers were more concerned with creating grandiose visuals than crafting a cohesive and engaging film.Lastly, the music and background score, which could have been a saving grace, fail to leave any lasting impression. The songs are forgettable, and the score is generic and uninspired, doing little to elevate the film or enhance the emotional impact of the scenes.In conclusion, Adipurush is a prime example of wasted potential. It squanders a compelling mythological tale with its poor storytelling, lackluster performances, inconsistent visual effects, subpar editing, and forgettable music. It's a movie that fails to entertain, engage, or leave any lasting impact on the viewer. Save yourself the disappointment and avoid this cinematic debacle at all costs.MeanwWhere do I even begin with Adipurush?

After watching for 5 minutes, he expressed disappointment, saying, ""Pappa, why is this movie like a cartoon?"" The director had everything needed to create an epic - the best cast for the lead roles: Prabhas, Kriti, Saif Ali Khan, and the Ramayana, which provides the best plot anyone could ever have, along with a 600 crore budget. The only thing lacking was a creative team. Every scene seems to be copied or inspired from other movies. I hope Om Raut's next movie will be a great success, as he would have learned many lessons from all the mistakes he made with this movie.

And finally Ravan! Please I never want this Ravan. Actually makers destroy the legends of Ramayan. They tried something but not up to the mark. Songs are also very bad. The legendary story is destroyed by the makers and Indian movie industry remembers this. Overall we don't want Ramayana like this, as Indian we love old Ramayana 1992.

This is one of the worst kids movie ever to be made. Irrespective of the topic when a complete movie is made with CGI, atleast the expectation was the CGI would be good. But even that is one of the worst like in a D grade movie. Having one of the biggest budgets ever alloted to a D grade CGI movie this is a failure of everyone who has worked on it, especially the director and all those innocent people who gave thier time and effort for this movie to be created. The only score that it deserved was for its music and background score. Not sure what the director and the producer intended to do here.

Isse Bakwaas Movie Jindagi mai nahi dekhi.A question to the director and the other heads, how can you be so irresponsible while making this masterpiece of a story into something trash? The blatant disregard for retaining the original character personalities is appalling. Ravan, a Brahmin devotee of Shiv, known for his vegetarianism, is completely transformed in this movie, which not only disrespects the original mythology but also has the potential to hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus.Let's talk about the VFX, or rather the lack thereof. Despite having a higher budget than Brahmastra, Adipurush fails to achieve even a fraction of the visual effects quality. It's clear that more effort should have been put into fixing the VFX instead of just superficially color grading the scenes.

This movie is big disappointment for every indians ,especially devotees of ram and hanuman, the makers distroyed the purity and respect and devotion of ramayan, they did not make story of ramayan they just tried to make cheap copy of marvel thats it. The script writer thinks he himself is 'valmiki'(writer of ramayan) .in the movie they show that devi sita is been trapped by holding knife in her neck where the hell did this happen in real story. And the vibhishan wife scene they showed her in short dress ,why was this scene made, its a movie related to god why did this happen, being a great devotee of ram truely upset with this film. And the big thing prabhas choosing these kind of script which is unreal. And in one scene ravan is getting massage from pythons and he is making the sword in another scene i didn't get i was watching story of ramayan ,the makers kept one thing real that ravan didn't touch sita it was appreciatablewhich was meaningfull and true. And vanar sena looks like gorillas they doesn't look like 'vanars'. Worst script and dialogues,worst casting, worst character designing, and fight scene with unkown creatures was also worst part which spoils your mood in start of movie itself. My hope is towards ranbir kapoors ramayan may it will be done good after this disaster. Upset for this being devotee of shree ram and hanuman.. May the team make good films ahead in the future. I dont hate the team but hate the work for this movie ,could have been great ..music was amazing .. Jai shree ram.

If you have watched the trailer of this movie, that was the best part of this movie. Now you can know how pathetic this movie is. I mean showing mata sita's killing by slitting the throat? WTF is that. Prabhash is below average actor in general but he is like 'C' grade actor in this movie no emotions, nothing.The best part of the movie is ending, I don't mean the the last scene I mean when movie ends you feel sigh of relief that you can go home. Manoj muntasir is a 3rd grade writer, he can't even fathom what he wrote.Please please don't go to watch this movie and try to waste your money there are many different ways where you can waste your money.

Overall everything was bad.I wonder how come so many people are giving more that 1 star for this pathetic movie. Please save you hard earned money.Watch the old Ramayan or watch the Japanese animation. Both are superb. An enquiry should be done on the whole crew on how come 600 crores where spent on this pathetic movie.Also there are many Prabhas fans who are such an idiot & praising this movie just because Prabhas is there. Be a fan but don't be an idiot. Respect your Culture.

356,24 June 2023," worst ramayan i have ever seen

Movie is not a movie it is a total insult of lord ram and acharya lankesh ravana. Ravan is a god is some regions in india. He is a brahman how he can even touch meat. And he is a king what do you think he used to make sward. And now when we come to lord hanuman he is a most ideal god who tells us how to be a devote. In this movie director and dialogue writer used such a cheap slang like lord hanuman is belong a society of mumbai called chaul. In short the imagination was worst, the cinematography was worst, the dialog are very poor and also not according to situations. Some characters who are very necessary in the ramayana is missing. The are showing that lord ram is angry in every scene but anyone even con't think that lord ram can be angry. After all he is maryada purshottam. We all have heard about lanka is made by gold and in the movie we feel like lanka was made by coal. And the dressing and hearing sense of every character looks like they are belongs to kaliyug. Some sceans are copyied by another movies.like the lanka looks exactly look like asgard city from thor ragnarok. And the last fight scene is copied form avangers 2012 . So in the last i would like to say that if anyone like to watch this movie in theaters don't think about it . You can watch ramayana tv show made by mr. Ramanand sagar so that you can know what true ramayan is.

I am rating this movie a 1 star The movie is showing anything which has never happened in Ramayana, they are showing the thing, I don't know from where these people got the storyline of this movie, they have made anything in the name of movie, If these people would have seen Ramanand Sagar's Ramayana, then such Ramayana would not have been made; today's generation will feel that all this must have happened in Ramayana. Those people have completely ruined Ramayana, I don't know why these people are making fun of our culture. Lord Ram himself will come and give them wisdom. Lord save us Jai Shri Ram.

Maligning the culture and horrible casting. Horrible customers and makeup looks like a c flick. No wonder Bollywood is losing its charm.There is nothing in rush movie worth watching. It's sad to even believe such an amount was spent in making the movie. Quite dubious to say the least. Something amiss.

Just the fact it is Ramayana should inspire respect. Which makes it baffling that the makers could write dialogues so lacking in grace and finesse. The tapori language and the barely understandable character development is a shame to the legend. For people who know Ramayana, the movie is a massive disappointment and waste of money, for those who don't it is a pathetically misleading waste of time. None of the characters embody the original charisma of the characters, despite the so-called star cast.Worst of all, the movie does't even seem original. It simply looks like a very badly edited collection of clips from various pre-existing movies.

362,20 June 2023," A Devastating Departure from the Epic
","
Adipurush, a highly anticipated 3D movie adaptation of the revered Indian epic Ramayana, falls short of expectations and fails to do justice to the beloved story. The film starts with a promising rendition of the Ram Siya Ram song, accompanied by beautiful illustrations. However, the movie quickly devolves into a disgraceful portrayal of the epic narrative.The cast's performances come across as forced, with Kriti lacking the motherly aura of Sita Mata and Prabhas seemingly trapped in his Bahubali phase. Saif Ali Khan's portrayal of Ravan is criticized for resembling a character from a DJ concert rather than a formidable antagonist.Several aspects of the movie are deeply disturbing. The language used in the dialogues, such as Hanumanji's disrespectful lines, feels offensive towards a revered deity. The film takes liberties with the story, introducing inaccurate and exaggerated elements, such as Ravana's anaconda massage and the depiction of him feeding meat to the bat (which on the first place is a question marks because apparently Pushpak Viman is replaced by a creepy bat) which contradicts his Brahmin background.Furthermore, the movie includes a random erotic scene, where an unknown woman is shown along with Vibhishan, and subsequently, the woman is shown changing clothes while Vibhishan is present nearby. This scene seems unnecessary and out of place in a narrative centered on a revered epic.Overall, Adipurush fails to maintain emotional connection with the audience and strays far from the original story of Ramayana. Its poor writing, lack of authenticity, and departure from the essence of the epic are notable drawbacks. The only redeeming aspect is the music composed by Ajay Atul, which receives praise for its quality.Considering the movie's shortcomings and offensive content, it is not recommended to spend time and money on watching Adipurush in theaters. The film's attempts at modernizing the epic story result in a disrespectful portrayal that may disappoint and alienate audiences who hold Ramayana dear.

I fail to understand where these people assumed the editorial rights to re-interpret and reimagine our Itihasa! The extremely poor execution only makes one feel that this has to be intentional. The damage it will do to the minds of the younger generation can be irreparable. No amount of justification, re-edits or apologies (although none can be expected from these folks anymore) can undo the garbage that has been thrown at the audience in the name of movie-making. Utterly disgusted!

The most disappointing movie of the decade, where Ravana appears as a poorly portrayed character from a local Gurugram village, and Lord Rama's depiction lacks conviction. Inderjit has more screen time than Sita Maa, resembling a perpetually vacationing pub owner. Kumbhkaran's presence is fleeting, while Bali's introduction is completely absent. The portrayal of Hanuman is remarkably feeble and unsatisfying. The characters in Lanka seem to be plucked from Ekta Kapoor TV shows or some cartoon shows. The movie is so tedious that my family lost interest after the intermission, with everyone feeling drowsy. I wonder why this movie was made at first place?

Adipurush- Monumental movie with heavy reliance on VFX as the main pillar. The essence of Ravana kidnapping Sita (portion of Ramayana) story is maintained with lots of liberty.With that sort of budget, graphics is on par with top budgeted Indian movies.Plenty of goosebumps moments- from Lord Rama meditating underwater to Hanuman ji meeting him for the first time with that warm hug, also carrying a mountain, to Vanara Sena building a bridge to Lanka with Jai Shri Ram song in the background, and finally the epic war scene that has been shot with guts and at grand scale.Kumbakarna (larger than life), Vanara Sena characters and their fights are depicted really well.Feast is to see Hanuman ji ""THE REAL SUPER HERO"" realizing his strengths and his counter attack. Devdatta Nage has worked hard to build that strong body and portraying Bajrang with utmost honesty.Saif Ali Khan has shown full character and given justice to Ravana's role, although his looks are really questionable (same with Indrajit).Kristin Sanon as Sita is good.Prabhas's role deserves a special mention just because of the supreme being shown as Lord Rama. His words, his deeds and actions are beyond one can imagine. This will overshadow Prabhas's acting skills as he shows little emotions during crucial scenes.Kids will love this movie.There are certain sections where movie could have been executed well.Yes, certain characterization could have been changed. Yes, certain creatures are questionable. Yes, certain dialogues could have been better. Yes, Ravana's kingdom is dark and western like (Dark theme could have been portrayed as Ravana's character).But no movie is perfect. Enjoy this imperfectness as our real superheroes battle with strong heart, with great courage and bring back respect/glory that is spoken for generations!Righteous, good deeds and the truth prevails over evil.Jai Shri Ram!

This is the one kind of movies you don't show kids, and get history mixed up.I couldn't even dare to complete the movie, and the damage it did is already worth 1star, and no amount of watching the remaining play is worth enough to change my rating from what it already is.I couldn't believe that I had watched this to the point I did. I believed the epic would be redone with modern tech, but alas, it was a new epic altogether. I feel sorry for Prabhas to have acted in this, and he was literally nowhere near the gracefulness required by Lord Ram. VFX are as bad as the rest of the under 3 review claims.Freedom has its value, but mangling history this way of a respected mythological epic is baffling in epic proportions. I'm more worried that my kids would actually watch this and get the facts wrong in scary nightmare version.I would instead show them better versions of this from the older movies where it doesn't suffer this level of mockery.Lord Ram is a character which symbolises great many things that not a single actor can truly cater in this age.I'm not a religious fanatic, but I'm educated enough to identify a mockery when I see one.So, it's a humble advice to parents who want to educate kids on the REAL Ramayan to literally avoid this at all costs, and instead get them to watch any earlier Ramayan epic movie to set the base of Ramayan right before they can get the history in this way under the banner of modern touch.Please don't fall for the VFX, they're sub-standard anyway.

""Adipurush"" attempts to bring the epic tale of the Ramayana to the big screen but falls short in several aspects. Directed by Om Raut, this fantasy action film fails to deliver a compelling narrative and suffers from subpar execution and reality. ""Adipurush"" has garnered attention by a good PR team in fooling people with religious sentiments, but unfortunately, it fails to live up to expectations.One of the few redeeming qualities of the film is its music. The soundtrack, composed by Ajay-Atul, is the only aspect that stands out positively. The songs are catchy and well-crafted, managing to evoke some emotions amidst the lacklustre storytelling.However, the screenplay and dialogue writing in ""Adipurush"" by Manoj Muntashir are extremely disappointingly below par. The dialogues lack depth and fail to resonate with the audience. The B-grade quality of the writing detracts from the overall viewing experience, making it difficult to fully invest in the characters and their journey.Another major drawback of the film is the poor visual effects (VFX). The CGI work appears unimpressive and unconvincing, diminishing the impact of the action sequences and fantastical elements. The film's attempt to create a visually stunning and immersive experience falls flat, leaving the audience underwhelmed.Comparatively, ""Adipurush"" pales in comparison to the animated movie ""Ramayana: The Legend of Prince Rama"" by Yugo Sako. Released years ago, Sako's film manages to capture the essence of the Ramayana with its beautiful animation, rich storytelling, and compelling characters.""Ramayana: The Legend of Prince Rama"" by Yugo Sako is a testament to the power of storytelling and deserves recognition, including an Oscar.In conclusion, ""Adipurush"" is a disappointing film that fails to deliver on its promises. Despite a commendable musical score, the weak screenplay, wrong facts and dialogue writing, along with the poor VFX, overshadow any positive aspects.When compared to the animated masterpiece ""Ramayana: The Legend of Prince Rama"" by Yugo Sako, ""Adipurush"" falls short in terms of storytelling and execution.It is a missed opportunity to bring the epic tale to life in a captivating and engaging manner.

It was more accurate and best adaptation by a non-Indian filmmaker (Japanese).And here we have an Indian with twisted mindset who twisted everything from Ramayana and made into mockery of Lord Rama, Lord Hanuman, Ravan, etc.Never in my wildest dream nor in wakeful state, have I watched a movie which is so pathetic and inaccurate depiction of our Holy Ramayana. It felt like watching a poor version of Harry Potter, Lord of The Rings, Games of Thrones and some bad animation with so many terrible VFX.

382,7 July 2023," Adipurush: A Flop on All Fronts
","
Sure, here is a bad review for the movie Adipurush:I gave the movie Adipurush a rating of 1 out of 10. I did not like the movie at all. It lacked in all aspects.The acting was mediocre at best. Prabhas was stiff and wooden as Lord Ram, and Kriti Sanon was bland and uninteresting as Sita. The supporting cast was also unremarkable.The visuals were also subpar. The special effects were cartoonish and unrealistic, and the sets and costumes were cheap and uninspired.The dialogue was cheesy and cringeworthy. The characters spoke in a modern, colloquial way that was completely out of place in a historical epic.Overall, Adipurush was a disappointing and underwhelming film. It is a missed opportunity to tell a classic story in a new and exciting way. I would not recommend this film to anyone.

Just to make an entertainment movie and earn huge money, Please don't play with the feelings and spirituality of Hindus.Ramayan is not just a story that you ca use for your movie, it's Our History and PrideIts okay your family told you the story in that manner without any discipline, but that doesn't change the true story.Either first study and understand deeply the history or don't make any movie adding modern entertainment to the Story.There are TV serials and Cartoons that produced Ramayan in such a beautiful way, shows with so much enthusiasm, learnings and knowledge without any modern technology qnd entertainment. Learn from them.Jai Shree Ram.

It's a really good movie. Do not go by negative comments . Use your own brain. Indian cinema has delivered Hollywood level quality. It's a mythical story and best indian fantasy portrayed amazingly. Must watch and kids will really enjoy. All the characters played really well . Story line is amazing. The story started from Ram's banabas and the struggle of survival. I guess after such a long time I have watched such an amazing fantasy . It's very intelligent thought that ramayan can be fantasize by such a way . Must recommend. Do not go by media's negative propaganda. You will miss it if you don't watch it . This should be watched in movie theater for sure.

When I saw the teaser and the trailer of this movie, I decided not to watch this movie and my decision was right as this movie got a lot of criticism. As the movie dropped on OTT, I thought to give it a try.Nothing went right in this movie, everything was messed up. The story, the screenplay, the direction, the performances of cast members, the CGI, the songs, the pacing and number of inaccuracies this movie had was unlimited. I have given ½ star for some good shots which I think were accidentally shot.Overall, I would never recommend this movie to anyone. It's an insult to our Hindu history and Ramayan.

There are certain movies that, for various reasons like the story, script, and dialogues, fall short. However, then there are stories that encompass all these elements; all one needs to do is utilize them properly to craft a good movie. Even if the movie isn't something extraordinary, these factors can still lead to substantial success.Om Raut had all the necessary ingredients, but unfortunately, he managed to create a complete mess out of it, resulting in the destruction of virtually everything you see in the movie.Movies involve the collaboration of hundreds of individuals. This raises the primary question: ""Wasn't there anyone who could have informed the creators about the poor quality of the movie they were producing?""Here's why:First and foremost, there's a considerable amount of copying. The initial scene, for instance, is an exact replica of Skeletor from HE-MAN. Other instances include elements borrowed from Harry Potter, like the dementors.The movie's issues with unoriginality don't end here. From Game of Thrones, the director employs a similar presentation for Ravan as Khaleesi, and instead of a dragon, there's a gigantic bat.The trend of copying from other movies persists throughout, with nearly every scene containing easily identifiable imitations. To add to the absurdity, the director even copies the Avengers' scene from NYC. It's essentially a frame-to-frame replication, missing only the Avengers' theme in the background. Not to mention the poorly executed imitation of Ram's character, heavily inspired by Hawkeye. Even the action scenes are reminiscent of Planet of the Apes, and this blatant copying is hard to ignore.The CGI is of abysmal quality-so bad that even an animated version might have been an improvement. The fight scenes were poorly executed, inadequately presented, and simply dreadful to watch.Prabhas, known for his role in Bahubali, appears to have achieved that success primarily due to S. S. Rajamouli's direction. Unfortunately, Prabhas has been consistently disappointing since that massive blockbuster. His decision to don a mustache leaves much to be desired.Kriti Sanon, however, managed to perform her character well. She fully immersed herself in the role and justified her selection. Despite her efforts, it's unfortunate that the movie's shortcomings overshadow her performance.Saif Ali Khan, the only character that seems to have adhered to the source material, isn't exempt from the director's misguided additions of machinery, steel masks, ogres, and other unnecessary changes, which ultimately diminish his efforts.Similarly, for Sunny Singh and Vatsal (who still requires acting classes), this could have been a breakthrough opportunity. However, it seems that this time, that wasn't the case.In conclusion, this movie is an utter waste of time-lacking substance, offering nothing to captivate the viewer, and poorly crafted overall.

How hard it can be to make a movie when you have a whole epic written for it, You have a content from past as a example. Dialogs are very cheap and background score is terrible.Om Raut as a director failed miserably in copying an assignment. This would dampen the stardom of Prabhas. Worst movie ever.It's surprising that how immature dialogs are. It felt like they have been copied from few meme pages. This display the sorry state of movies being made in India now.It's surprising that how immature dialogs are. It felt like they have been copied from few meme pages.

Watched it yesterday. Didn't like first action sequence as it was unrealistic for Ramayana age.But best vfx for hindi cinema till date.Prabhas didnt look good in trailer but in the movie he was perfect. Ram, Sita and ravana roles were the best. Yes some 2-4 dialogues were misfit but thats just 2 minutes of the 3 hour long movie so you will not even notice it. Don't know why anti Indians always take advantage of every situation to demean the very culture of India and cofuse people.I think the Hanuman ji's role and actor was not perfect.But director had good grip on the direction throughout amd kept us engaged.It was the perfect blend on modernity and old times.Loved the movie.Songs were appropriate and background music was perfectly fitting.Strongly recommend to go with whole family to watch it so that kids can also see the grandiose and character of our Gods.

389,18 August 2023," A differently presented version of the epic
","
A lot has been said and discussed about this movie in respect of the script, direction, dialogue, special effects etc. The story of Ramayan is ingrained in the minds of all Indians since childhood and they have set perceptions of the epic. This movie is the maker's interpretation and perception on how the iconic and much revered characters would look, behave and talk. The right way to review this movie however, is to assess how effectively the director has translated his screenplay onto the screen.I think director Om Raut has managed to effectively cater to audiences of all age groups. All characters are naturally shown larger than life with huge sized Saif Ali Khan as Ravan much more so. There is an unavoidable element of characters acting as if on stage rather than facing the camera. This approach has remained part and parcel of this epic whenever and wherever performed. Low key presentation would have looked unappealing. If one were to accept that he/ she is watching a differently conceived and performed "" Ram Leela"" then there should be no problem. Not exactly boring at any time, this movie with a long runtime has few deviations in script / concept from the earlier movies. All actors have done satisfactorily. Saif particularly has put in an impressive performance. The sets, cinematography and special effects have created the desired fantasy.

Maybe because Netflix' Grey Skull ain't happening anymore, Skeletor still needed a movie to play in.Even though I was curious to know what more funny / stupid stuff would happen, I also knew it would be a waste of my time, so I shut it off to write my review about the first ten minutes of the movie.

All the scenes in the movie is like a jigsaw puzzle catered from different movies like Thor, land of apes, bahubali, time machine, a angers etc. It's really not worth an ounce watching. No introduction of characters.From Ramayan,
The important scene in which Hanumanji was reminded about his powers there's a funny weird sound of monkeys hooting.In one scene, there's a funny walk by Ravan with Sita for no reason.Vibhishan aesthetics were like a handsome guy met in a pub.The whole movie looks like there was no Sunlight in Sri Lanka.Ravan looks like Mohammed Gauri all time.Kumbkaran looked like a haryanvi bouncer.Expressions of Laxmanji were almost as if he lost the interest in doing a movie midsway.Brahmaji, akash wani in the last was from narshima holika story for no reason got connected to Ravan.Even Ram ji speech from bahubali was presented in a pathetic way as if he is ditching the vanar sena by saying, ""fight for yourself and not for me"".Better watch some other Sci fi movie.

Ravana is a Brahmin and a decent guy except for the greed and the director portrayed him as Alladin Khilji.. Lanka is the most beautiful place on earth with advanced and most beautiful architecture. Lanka is called Bangaru Lanka(Gold) which was build by prestigious architech Vishwakarma. And movie shows Lanka as black Booth bangla?

How not to make a movie on epics which revered by billions of people. This movie fails on many fronts poor characterization, screenplay, dialogues. First, they did not read epic ramayana or not listen to ramacharitamanas or not seen ramand sagar ramayana. They failed to portray the essence of the characters and brings lot of western style narrative. One such example is Ravana character purely based on western style narrative no indic values or style. Wondering, our movie makers failing to potray a very well known character in to a movie? They failed in every front lack in screenplay, character development. A epic blunder.

This movie Adipurush is streaming on Netflix and even there were lots of reviews that were against this movie,I decided to watch it to know why the most of the reviews were against this movie. Everyone knows it's a disaster movie but I wanted to know it personally why people called it a disaster movie. Since I had no money to lose so decided to give it a try.The movie has lots of VFX and it's beautiful too. You can understand why it is called high budget movie. First of all,since childhood when we talk about Ramayana,we talk about Ram,Laxman,Sita,Hanuman but here it was Raghav,Shesh,Janki and Bajrang. The names were not familiar to us. Secondly Ravana had 10 heads which were one above the other,that was too not familiar to us. Again when Hanuman goes to Dronagiri in search of Sanjeevani,he brings the mountain because he thought apart from Shesh others might need it but we always read that only because Hanuman couldn't recognize Sanjeevani booti,he brings the whole mountain with him. I think creativity is good and when a person creates a good different story out of an old outline it's highly commendable. But when the outline is about any religion and religious sentiment,it should never be altered or changed. Ravana is shown taking snake massage and again that we never heard in our entire life. Had this been a very good movie if the makers would have a totally new story idea but they made a huge mistake by take Ramayana as the base of their story. The positive side of this movie is that the music is very good and of course VFX is good,but overall it's not at all a good movie.

Take a bit of Avengers and Lord of The Rings, add a pinch of Game of Thrones, and top it up with Temple Run and Adipurush is served. Agreed it's no easy feat to recreate an epic tale, but with all the research and material at hand, through Tulsidas' Ramcharitmanas and Valmiki's Ramayana, if this is director Om Raut's best take on the contemporary Ramayana, we need to go back and revisit the original in all its glory, and restore our sanity. Adipurush is merely a Bollywood-ised version of one of the most epic tales that ever existed. Considering the significance of Ramayana's place in Indian mythology and literature, the directors should have put more of their heart and soul into creating it. Despite the great performance by the actors playing Ram and Hanuman, the movie still is able to show much gloss and not much substance.

406,25 June 2023," Adipurush is the best adaption of Ramayana by far
","
Adipurush is predominantly an Indian Hindu mythological devotional movie. Taking it as a superhero movie will not work. It's basically about the triumph of good over evil. Seeing it on the big screen, I felt transported to Threthayuga when Rama fought Ravana fought his righteousness. The movie is a retelling of Ramayana from Vanavasa (serving a 14-year exile in the wilderness) to Yuddakanda (ultimate war between Rama and Ravana in Lanka) with computer generated graphics mostly the backdrops and additional characters like vanaras and demons. Because it's a beloved mythological story, we do not need explanations and details which are obviously omitted to fit in the length of the file which is near 3 hours.The songs by Ajay-Atul are very soulful and fit the mood of the movie and transcending. The characters portrayed by Prabhas as Raghava, Kriti as Janaki, Saif as Ravana and Devdatta as Bhajrang are very befitting. In fact, they make the beloved story much more comprehensible through their expressions. The narration is very simple and yet contains the major incidents and details which are crucial for the viewer to feel the proceedings rather than just watching them but at the same time omit the minor details which are present in the scriptures. Direction mostly focuses on the emotional aspects of the film and tries to enhance the viewing experience rather than making the viewer indulging in the chronological occurrences of that period of time, which are obviously present in the books and TV series.It has been a controversy causing movie since it offended the sentiments of masses due to the deviation of narration and some dialogue from the source material but what I felt is that it's just an another adaption of Ramayana. We cannot compare it with Ramanand Sagar's 80's TV series Ramayana as it was also an adaption of Tulisidas's Ramcharitmanas. So, there is no truth in any adaption or interpretation of the story as the original story by Valmiki itself was his own interpretation of what happened during the Thretayuga.Prabhas excels as Raghava and Saif excels as Ravana and Kriti is believable as Janaki. Though there is more focus on Ravana for establishing the fact that the greater the evil the greater the victory of good over it. Music is very soulful especially the title track Ram Siya Ram and background score is apt. Production values are good, though computer generated, considering the fact that it's the most expensive Indian film by far.Despite some flaws, I just suspended my disbelief during some scenes where there was an exaggeration of dialogue or lack of some precise CGI or over-use of CGI and color tone and it worked for me and could enjoy the movie for what it is. At least, it's much better than the junk shown in marvel movies which are completely factitious comic-based. Ramayana is not factitious as it's proven happened for real by the archeological evidences in Ayodhya time and time again. So, the real legacy of Raghuvamsa is translated on screen with CIG enhancements for the audiences' watching pleasure and taking it that way is the only option or if one is to point out the mistakes in it would simply mean that one cannot enjoy anything that's presented for grasping.The Ramayana story, no matter how it is told, is timeless and timely - timeless because the story is first of its kind, true and eternal and timely because the values still hold good in modern times. It's not just about the war between Rama and Ravana but the fighting ones inner demons which are much worse than 10-headed Ravanasara and can be applied to ones own complete inner conflicts rather than to external entities, as a takeaway.Overall, from what I have experienced, Adipurush is the best adaption of Ramayana by far - 11 out of 10 stars!

The film stars Prabhas as Raghava, the prince of the Ikshvaku dynasty, who sets out to rescue his wife, Janaki (Kriti Sanon), from the demon king Lankesh (Saif Ali Khan).My main problem with Adipurush is that it feels like a pale imitation of Western films like Game of Thrones. The characters are one-dimensional and the plot is predictable. The action sequences are well-choreographed, but they are too long and drawn-out.I understand that the makers of Adipurush were trying to do something different with the Ramayana story, but I think they missed the mark. The film is too long, too violent, and too dark. It is not a film that I would recommend to anyone.I also found the film to be quite dark and violent. The Ramayana is a story that has been told and retold for centuries, and it is usually a story of good versus evil. However, Adipurush takes a more cynical approach, and it often feels like the film is reveling in the violence.The characters are one-dimensional. Raghava is a generic hero, Janaki is a damsel in distress, and Lankesh is a mustache-twirling villain. The plot is predictable. You can guess what is going to happen from the very beginning. The action sequences are too long and drawn-out. They take up a lot of the film's running time, and they become boring after a while. The film is too dark and violent. There is a lot of blood and gore, and it is not suitable for younger viewers.Overall, I was disappointed with Adipurush. It is a film that tries to be too many things at once, and it ultimately fails to do any of them well. I would give it 1 star out of 5.

Pathetic potrayal of India's most iconic story.Never show this movie to your kids... Better show the Ramanand Sagar version which we used to see on Doordarshan during our Childhood days.... This movie will give a very negative impression on a child's mind about our Gods.One request to the Ramanand Sagar's producers to pacify the audience coming out of adipurush show would be to sell the the best version.Most disappointing in the movie is the potrayal of Hanuman ji....such a waste of 600 Cr. Should have listened to the trollers that this is 600Cr ka cheap version of Chota Bheem.If anyone whom you know is planning to watch this .. pls tell them not to...

I love to see the Representation of the movie partially based on valmiki Ram. Sri Ram with mustache people don't like because they don't know their own oldest culture which is lost from generation. There is mention of facial hair of sri Ram In Valmiki Ramayan in two plot when during hanuman describe about Sri Ram in front of sita to convince her that he is the real Ram messenger and during return to Ayodhya when Bharat called barber to shave Ram and lakshman. Generation changed Valmiki Ramayana changed (to Tulasi Ramayana) and Ram Mustache also changed 😓. Happy that Om ji brought it back.Love the Sita Abduction visual best way to represent within 5m entire plot although not 100 percent same as ramayan.Savari entering in fire, Killing o Sita by Meghanad , Samudra dev, end fight are the best plot based Valmiki Ramayana.Hanuman never wears any ornaments in Valmiki ramayan so it's exactly the same in the movie.In valmiki Ramayana lord Ram had somya roop with friends and Good people but Rudra roop for Raksha and danav who goes against Dharma.Ram fight with demon concept visualization looks great but needs a good budget.3D effect looks cool.As this movie is based of Sri Ram's strength on war scene so don't expect him to Calm expect to see his Rudra roop but motion capture technique fail to capture Ram angers also don't know why need more improvement on this technique on India?The Janaki role is just Perfect 👍.It's India's first Motion capture Movie, although it's able to Capture the motion not perfect but still good but it fails to capture facial emotions of Animals characters. It's ok because progress needs time it's their first attempt and with a low budget as compared to Hollywood motion capture movies nearly 3 times more budget.Worst Bgm Chennai express Background music during war 😅, rather than those bgm they should put Sanskrit sloka during Epic moment like hanuman carrying mountain ,travelling ocean meeting Sri Ram and all war scenes etc.Worst Dialogue written for Indrajit and Hanuman.Message to the filmmakers. "" Stop making Ramayan like movie in one part these kinds of movie need more than 5 part for character development in order to connect with Characters .By looking at the Visual concept of adipurush it's clear that they have the potential and technology but Screen play does matter to develop the Character. Make movie pert Like Ram Vann Bhas, Sita Abduction, Ram sugreev Melan, lanka Dahan, etc.... Jay Adipurush (not Ram? The Oldest person on Universe who still exists now)Some of the greatest Visual In Indian Cinema. Some Hollywood standard Visual with low budget.

If I have to say overall this movie is a big let down. The huge budget does not do any justice to the way the movie has been made and the dialogues written. Even to some extent the looks of the character look pathetic, especially Raghav or Shri Ram. Prabhas's makeup is bad to be honest. Arun Govil looked so much better in Ram's role. Huge amount of VFX has been used which looks like a cartoon movie. Nothing looks real. Lanka is more like Mordor (but does not even come close to the VFX of LOTR). Ravan's ride is straight copied from GOT but the dragon looks like a toy. The dialogues are ok (if not great) in the first half but they become poor in the second half totally. The final battle had to be epic but it turns out as bad as Raghav's look.Watch it if you want to see to what extent an Epic can be butchered.

Adipurush is good movie. Shows the story of Ramyana. Ram and Sita story and Ram and Raavan story. IN this film Ram is Raghava played by Prbhas. Sita is Jankai played by Kriti Sanon. And Saif ALi Khan is Raavan (Lankesh) in this movie. Good acting by Bajrang charcter also played by Devdutt Nage. I loved the peroformancce of Saif ALi Khan Prabhas and Kriti Sanon also in this movie. Nice acting by all the cast. Good music. Nice story. Very well visually presented and good storytelling. DUbbing - Hindi dub is also clear to listen. Only the last fight scenes were little dark and less light that could have been worked then this film is a really good movie. I loved watching this movie. Was involved in the movie right from start to the fighting part in the pmovie. Fighting part was a little srak there my attention went off. I recommend you to watch this movie. I loved the scene where Raghav killing Lankesh. In the movie not only this, many other scenes were visully appealing like the Lankesh charcter entering Sita's place and taking away gim him and many more. I loved Saif ALi KHan's look as Sadhu but not as Lankesh or Raavan. But Saif ALi KHan carried his charcter Raavan on hiss shoulders and did it really well. I had a great time watching this movie. Recommend you to watch Adipuruhs. I rate the movie 10 stars on 10. THe dark fight scene towards the last I wont ccut stars bcs it is shot really well. Fighting part was a little stretched in the movie. This movie deserves 10 stars. I dont want to reduce my stars for Adipurush movie. Bcz I loved the overall storytelling. Prabhs voice andd his muscualar body well suited for his charcter of Ram also Raghav. I loved the Sheetal Dhara song. It was one of the beautfiul visuallly appealing songs of the film.

Please do not watch this movie as it has nothing good even bad i think it was produced to make people forgot old ramayana it's like the non hindu people made this with almost zero knowledge of it
after the controversies
the director/producer says that adipurush is not Ramayana it is inspired by Ramayana so why the hell they reserve a seat for shri hanuman in all theaters why ?TBH it is worst than i thought.

Pathetic movie ruin all the characters and no emotional connect at all. These not a single dialogue written neatly.The dialogue further adds to the film's disgrace. The characters communicate disrespectfully with each other. Prabhas, portraying Ram, addresses Sita by his father-in-law's name (Janki). Hanuman's character is muzzled, hindering proper communication. Most of the dialogue feels as if it were penned by an amateur writer, lacking the depth and knowledge expected from a well-versed writer.If you want to watch a Ramayana just watch old Ramayana in YouTube don't waste your time and money for this worst movie.

This is indeed should have been the best movie but lot of shortfalls.Character exploration is not at all good, creative freedom is still okay with many incidents taking a new line, but characters should have been introduced much better.Dialogues again creative freedom is okay, but in the movie Lord rama says to Sitamma just before ravanas act in the forest that ""she can go back to ayodya its not too late"", but this act of ravana happens in the 13th year of the exile, which makes no senseAt places felt starcast was not right, except for hanuman jiThe only thing i enjoyed with goosebumps moments are during the bgm and songsAll in all the director should have done a better job by consulting more about Ramayana, to find the spark in each character, including Lord Ram, Sitamma Hanuman ji, lakshmana, Shabari, vali sugreev, jatayu, ravan,vibhishan, kumbkarana, also inderajeeta son of ravana.

In a disheartening turn, this pivotal tale has been mishandled with a surprising lack of care. The film's narrative appears to lack careful consideration, raising doubts about its release. The potential ramifications of such a portrayal on young audiences could be problematic for future understanding of the Ramayana. A more diligent approach involving thorough research, immersion in traditional presentations, and studying the exemplary ""Ramayana"" series could have ensured a graceful and simplified depiction.Should one perceive the antagonist as Raavan, a potential source of misunderstanding about the Ramayana emerges. While the film's visual effects are subpar, the crux of the issue lies not in these effects but in the portrayal of characters and their actions. Take, for instance, Raavan's peculiar appearance, blending elements of Islamic leaders and peculiar attire. His inexplicable bat-riding lacks justification, while his entourage appears more caricature-like than substantial.Indrajit's portrayal, akin to the Flash with Conor McGregor's attire, seems out of place for the Ramayana's context. A feeling of connection is elusive in the film's introduction of Lord Rama, his battle against anonymous computer-generated creatures lacking clarity. Even though the Ramayana boasts a rich narrative, Raavan's motivations in the film appear juvenile and muddled. A scene involving Laxman's arrow and Raavan's sister comes across as juvenile and unfinished, and the attempt to condense Lord Rama's exile into a fleeting three-minute scene leaves little room for character immersion.The sole moment of connection arrives through a brief animated scene with Jatayu, though this attachment remains stronger with the bird than with Mata Sita or Lord Rama. The reliance on computer-generated imagery is evident even in the portrayal of Saif Ali Khan, with his head seemingly hovering atop a fabricated body, sporting ten heads. Lord Rama's character feels mechanical, lacking the depth expected of a multi-dimensional portrayal of a divine figure.The culmination sees Lord Rama's triumph over Raavan, yet uncertainties linger about the strategic arrow that fells the antagonist. Raavan's passivity following this event remains puzzling. The film's conclusion indulges in an extensive thirty-minute display of computer-generated visuals, eclipsing the narrative's core and obstructing character connection.The dialogues falter, oscillating between formal Hindi and slang, disrupting the film's flow. Lord Hanuman's dialogue choices lack reverence, while another character's choice of words lacks decorum and respect. The film's dialogue fails to honor the nuances of these esteemed characters.In summation, this film stands as a profound letdown. Followers of Lord Rama and audiences in general would be prudent to abstain from investing their time and resources in this endeavor. Evading this cinematic venture is a sound decision, given its misrepresentation of a cherished tale and its characters.

Why does someone have to spend 600 cr to make such a disaster?? And how in God's name did it make 350cr at the box office?Adipurush has no role in this movie except for that motivational speech before the fight. From the time the dude went underwater in the first scene to when he tried to kill Ravana, all his duties were being outsourced. Next Janaki.. Holy smokes, she's got no role in the movie apart from sitting under the cherry blossom tree! Hanuman aka Bajrang is the main character of the film. He's there everywhere. Rama's brother Bharata brought the soldiers of Ayodhya to help Rama. Where is he in this movie??And Ravana = Thanos + Thor!!I am surprised there was no item song in the movie. They should have brought in Shurpanaka to do an item song, that would have been the cherry on the cake!!My God, I find it difficult to believe that the cast and crew spends ridiculous amounts of money to go study theater and then make a fool of those institutions!!

I watched the movie on Netflix.The movie starts with a min long disclaimer reading about creative liberties and how they want the audience to keep an open mind.Thats goes to show, the writers and directors know they effed up due to the reaction of the audience.But I kept an open mind, enjoying every aspect of the movie, but yes, at times it was difficult.They writers could have explored the journey of their vanwaas than just concentrating on the last year or so with their encounter of Ravan. They could have also explored the divine weapons, but Bhramastra was occurred only once.The infamous Pushpak Viman was shown 3-4times on screen, but Ravan decides to use a Bat.In choice of actors, Kriti Sanaon and Saif Ali Khan did an excellent job, given the characters.Prabhas I believe was a wrong choice to depict Ram. Prabhas brought the same character of Bahubhali to this movie. When Ram is supposed to show divinity and wisdom, which translated into a warrior. He displayed arrogance at times, and was more concerned with dialogue delivery.The visual effects were way bad, with this day and age, such beginner stuff is not expected. Right from the first scene, the effects were bad.Even the monkey army which was designed was just copy and paste.The characters that they inserted. The Rakshas looked like ogres, some initial ones looked like Dementors. But atleast they sent a good message, when they showed one rakshas flossing his teeth!!!Overall the movie should have been a series or atleast in 2-3 parts, where they could have explored the Ramayan, and a huge missed opportunity. The script writer should have interviewed experts, and the dialogue writer should have stuck to nice dialogues depicting knowledge and divinity than chapripan.

The movie has deeply hurt my religious sentiments! Strict action should be taken against everyone who was involved in making this joke, So nobody dares to mock Hinduism ever again! ""Does anyone imagine the religious characters to be in existence in the way they are shown in the movie? The attire worn by the characters in the movie, do we imagine our gods to be like this? Ramcharitmanas is a sacred text, people recite it before leaving their homes and you depict it in such a pathetic way. Few people could not watch the film completely. Those who respect Lord Rama, Lord Laxman and Maa Sita, they can not watch such a movie.

Hope Mr Raut doesn't make a movie again. This could have been an epic but it's a disaster. Don't think the makers of this movie watched it before releasing it. Songs are not required for this movie but they have been imposed on the audience. Don't waste your hard earned money on this disaster of a movie.

""Matrix Revolutions"": Get ready for an eyeful of CGI gone haywire! The film throws in a gazillion computer-generated tricks that might leave you more puzzled than a Rubik's cube. They practically handed the VFX team a blank check and let them loose in a candy store. What's the result? A visual whirlwind that's more chaotic than a thunderstorm in a teacup.Now, let's talk dialogue - or lack thereof. Forget about meaningful conversations; it's all about actors bouncing around like kangaroos on caffeine. You'd think you stumbled into a trampoline park rather than a movie theater. Picture this: 90 minutes of 90% SFX. It's like watching a fireworks show on steroids, minus the 'oohs' and 'aahs.'If Marvel ever had a really bad day and produced something during nature's call, this movie might be the result. It's a full-on CGI overdose, drowning out every bit of substance. This flick isn't just bad; it's like biting into a whole lemon when you expected lemonade. Trust me, this one's a contender for the hall of shame.

I liked the forward thinking vision of this movie. Grew up watching Ramananda sagar's never ending Ramayan series.. but this one depicted everything in one featured film which I think is an awesome job by the creators. I couldn't have imagined Ramayan could be made in this modernized way kudos to the filmmakers.There is flaw in Valmiki's Ramayan from the beginning so one shouldn't expect flawless movie. Lord Ram who is incarnation of lord Vishnu who is absolute vegetarian fighting a war and killing all those lives is itself contradiction so watching this movie on Netflix I have no complaints. I wished I could have gone to the threader to watch this movie.. could have been more entertaining.This is very unfair to the creators.. they don't deserve this kind of low rating for all their inspiring vision and hard work.

I couldn't believe why they would release such kind of a product. If the young minds of today get their understanding of Valmiki Ramayana from this movie then I don't know what will happen in near future.If this will be their Raavan then i don't know what exactly will they think of Ramayana in the first place. Absolutely lack luster VFX isn't the only problem with this film. Rather VFX is much less of a problem in this movie. The main flaw is in this representation that has been made by the makers. Raavan has an attire of an islamic dictator. He has been shown wearing a t-shirt along with leather straps over him with spiky hairstyle and rather non-sense get up. He is shown riding a bat but there is no mention of why he is riding a bat, is that pushpak vimaan or what. Characters around him are just goofy men or rather cartoons in his army who behave like lord of the rings character. Indrajit is shown as a guy having powers of Flash and attire of Connor McGregor. I can't imagine this being Ramayana.The first point of Introduction of Rama is pathetic. Shree Ram is shown as fighting some random CGI demons. Who are they? Why are they attacking Sita? Nothing is told as if it's a cartoon film. Even with such a story like that of Ramayana, Raavana's motivations are so childish and vague that we still don't know what he wants. We are shown a scene worth of 2 mins where Ravana's sister gets her nose cut by Laxman's arrow. That scene is so childish. Every detail about Rama's vanvaas is shown to us in a 3 minutes introduction. The movie doesn't want you to connect with any character. The most connected I was to a character was Jatayu which was just for a 3 minutes CGI sequence. Still I was more connected to it than Sita maa, Shree Ram or any one else.

This movie and its film makers had an opportunity to make this film a revolutionary blockbuster not just in terms of numbers but also in interms of cinema recognisition from people around the globe because ramayana is not mere a mythology, it is history of ancient india, and world needed to see this on a bigger screen. However, everyone from filmakers to actors didn't grasp the orginality and emotions that ramayana holds for indian public, otherwise they would have made it from a perspective of a common man in a simple and subtle way. Had they made this film like ramananda sagar did, this film would have been a success not only in india but worldwide. Sadly, the filmakers missed this opportunity and not only they blatantly made joke of our historic text and misrepresented it, but also sent a message to the world that indians themselves don't respect and understand their own holy scriptures. Having said that, i am going to binge watch ramanand sagar's ramayan on youtube, and i'll advise everyone who haven't watched it, go watch it and save your money by ditching this movie.

Story: Ramayan is an epic, which every Indian knows by heart. The story involves the biggest God of the third most populous religion in the world. Rewriting such a thing is one of the biggest mistakes.E.g. Shabri placement was wrong,
vaidya sushen was replaced by a seductive lady,
Rawan shown as lord of Bats,
pushpak viman replaced by a dragon,
langur resembling army of Sugreev replaced by many different breeds of monkeys,
Meghnad becomes Flash from Hollywood. The whole movie is full of goof ups.Dialogues: not up to mark. A much more decent language was expected.Development of Characters: each character in Ramayan is very beautifully developed. But Adipurush was not able to develop even a single character. Hanuman ji, Ravan, Sugreev, meghnad and all others needed some better representation. The movie disappointed me here. The movie wasted more than half an hour panning and zooming on Ram and Rawan from different angles. It became so boring that we felt like having a remote to forward the scenes. Unfortunately we were in theatre.Music: Background score was cacophonic. With the story so long you don't have a place for a song sequence but they decided to insert some extremely forgettable songs.Computer Graphics: It felt like the whole movie was shot on a green screen. The movie was full of animations and animations were poorer than the first Harry Potter. Low FPS was really disappointing.Direction: It can simply compete in the most poorly directed movies/play/tv show ever made, based on Ramayan.Picturisation: they have used lots of CG and animation which, as I mentioned is of poor quality. Most of the movie is dark. Lanka is black coloured.Actors: kriti Sannon looks Beautiful, and did justice to her role, Prabhas looks and feels almost like bahubali. Sunny Singh looks unconvincing as a short tempered Laxman. Hanuman's make up was really bad. But the biggest wastage was of one of the finest Actors Saif Ali Khan. The way he was waving his shoulders was strange. All of them are great actors, but it seems like the director got confused in the technology and art of movie making.Opinion: I normally read IMDB reviews before going to a cinema. But today I specifically downloaded its app to write this review on this movie.

430,22 June 2023," A new take on Ramayana.

To begin with, ""Adipurish"" is a captivating movie that deserves at least one viewing. It offers a fresh perspective on the epic tale of Ramayana by presenting Ravana not only as a king but also as an engineer and blacksmith.This movie explores the possibilities of Ramayana, particularly within the Indian context. It acknowledges that the oldest and most authentic version of the Ram Katha originates from the Buddhist Jatak Stories, specifically the Dasharath Jatak Katha.Alongside the Buddhist version, there are also Jain Ramayana and Brahminical Ramayanas, with Valmiki Ramayana being the oldest among the latter.It's important to note that there exist hundreds of variants of the Ramayana, and ""Adipurush"" adds a unique narrative to this extensive list. The story is an intriguing interpretation primarily based on Valmiki's Ramayana, diverging from the more popular Ramacharit manas, a 500-year-old rendition in the Awadhi language by the author Rambola Dubey, also known as Tulsidas.Overall, ""Adipurush"" offers an interesting and distinct exploration of the Ramayana story, making it a worthwhile experience to delve into.

On the unusual decent rating of three stars out of five, i.e., six out of ten:The film has been thrashed since the launch of the teaser, and I had given up completely on the movie. Countless negative reviews, memes, trolled trailers, and commentary on the poor dialogue and VFX---the stream of critique on the movie was endless. I just went in anticipating the worst thing. And when the movie was over, I felt it was not ""that"" bad. Gets an extra star just because I was sensitized to bad bits, and the good bits felt decent, so it ended up been an anticlimactic experience for me. Had I gone in blind, I would have rated it either one or two... the anticipation of absolute worst helped. Also the acceptance of the movie being a ""loosely-adapted"" film based on Ramayana---just another action flick---helped me to just relax and watch it without the burden of negative publicity. Don't do the folly of equating it to the Ramayana despite what the title, the moviemakers, or other people affiliated with the movie say---life will be much easier that way; otherwise, all you will see is endless flaws, and then even negative stars would be insufficient to rate the movie.Coming to the movie:Major things that did not work for me:a) Prabhas: One-tone angry man look. It has been six years since Baahubali 2 released, and he is still caught in that Baahubali mold. Awful. All his T-series flicks, including Saaho and Radhe Shyam, have been horrendous. Perhaps it was the genius of Rajamouli and freshness of Prabhas to non-Telugu audiences that shined in the Baahubali duology.B) Color grade of the film: Even in a 4k premiere theater with a 3D show, the entire film looks so dark. Many things are not visible at all, which might have been done to hide the many valid criticisms when the teaser was launched. No day shots or lack of light felt so off throughout the film.C) Animation: There are several interesting, nice bits of VFX and animation in the film mixed with equally poor, low-quality, horrendous effects. The most notable of the poor animation shots being everything to do with the Vanar army (Lord Ram's army) and Lanka army (Ravana's army). The sequence of Bali and Sugriva fight was simply yuck. Several of the animation shots were simply unrefined and done without due attention to the detail. The intro scene of Lord Ram also felt shoddy (I was like what the heck are Dementors doing in the film 😂).Major thing that worked for me:a) Sound: The sound department did good (not talking about the music here). Perhaps it was the Atmos effect, or the choice of my seating to be in the dead center of the theatre, that the sound effects and design felt good throughout the movie.B) Watching on a big screen in 3D. The scenes getting trolled everywhere did not look ""that"" bad in a big, good-quality theatre. Also some visual effects looked nice.C) Once you accept that the film is ""very"" loosely based on the original text, I liked the dark, evil (and comical in parts) portrayal of Ravana and Lanka. Although I am sure that I am in a rare company here.On Om Raut: I liked his Lokmanya Ek Yugpurush, and thought that Tanaji was okayish--sub-par at best unlike how much people enjoyed it. The difference in quality of the two films is fairly evident when you switch from a real movie like Lokmanya into the use of VFX and animation heavy film like Tanhaji. Tanhaji felt unreal, visually dark, and unrefined in the CGI domain. Alas it at least had some live action unlike Adipurush where they bit more than they could chew---everything looks so cartoonish. Very little feels live action, which is a major bane of the film.On Manoj Muntashir Shukla: I did not give much attention to the dialogues, so no comments---although I can firmly say that at least the dialogues were not as awful as in Brahmastra 😂.

Very poor aesthetics. Poor casting. Over the top VFX and screenplay. Noisy promos held no promise at all. They forecasted the kind of movie it was going to be. No accuracy. No morality. No language discipline. It's a shame in the name of a religious saga. Where are the cultural and religious watchdogs? How could the censorship board pass it? Not a single scene is watchworthy, let alone praiseworthy. The Japanese animated Ramayans were way better than this headache picture that does not evoke the tiniest of devotion. It's like the cheap currency notes introduced by the Indian government post demonetisation.

There is no need for so much hate towards this masterpiece. It was very well made. Was it perfect, ofcourse not, no movie is, but the time and effort that was put into the film must be appreciated. Yes the VFX could have been improved, but the design and execution was excellent. Watch it to enjoy it and not tear it down, as you're missing the point. Watch it and embrace the story. There has never been such a telling of the Ramayan done to meticulously with a good use of technology. Hats off to Om. Some elements from the Ramayan are absent, but this is meant to be a movie.Do yourself a favour and enjoy it for what it is meant to be. I hope this does not discourage the filmmakers, and they make m ore films like these. I found the visual aesthetic pleasing, you do want to see some flawed VFX.There is so much thought that went into the production value and design. So appreciate all of this.

I was very disappointed with Adipurush. The VFX was terrible, the acting was subpar, and the dialogue was cringeworthy. The film felt like a low-budget, amateur production.The acting was also very poor. Prabhas was miscast as Rama. He didn't have the charisma or the gravitas to pull off the role. Saif Ali Khan was the only actor who gave a decent performance.The dialogue was also very bad. It was full of cheesy one-liners and forced humor. It felt like the writers were trying too hard to make the film cool and edgy.The film also disrespected the Ramayana. It took the epic story and turned it into a shallow, action-packed spectacle. The film's makers seemed to have no understanding of the religious and cultural significance of the Ramayana.

Ravan character done the proper justification and Saif sticks well. Bgm is superb and songs too. Particularly I like Ravan sivoham song. Looks fresh and getting goosebumps. If graphics would be better it will get good ratings. Graphics not apt for big budget. Overall nice experience.

Such pathetic direction or script can only be made if someone made it just for fun. It is an utter mockery of Ramayana and should be a crime to produce such movies. This movie would make ""Joker"" or ""Jaani dushman"" feel like blockbusters. Graphics like this is usually found on free chinese apps on android playstore. These graphics in Adipurush feels like Roadrash and similar games of the 1990s.I don't even want to talk about the dialogues. It feels like conversation among a group of teenagers who are drunk. I don't understand how Saif Ali Khan or Prabhas agreed to be involved in this. Maybe they need to develop a little more IQ.

After all the hullabaloo since the release, I thought of giving the movie a chance when it released on OTT. It is NOT Ramayan nor it is the tribute to Ramayan. It is fever dream of Manoj Muntashir. Director woke up from the slumber longer than that of Kumbhkarn and started the movie without realising what he is making. Out of the stated 600 cr movie budget, a hefty sum of 600 INR was spent on VFX. The 1975 released movie Jai Santoshi Ma had better graphics than Adipurush. Prabhas was as bland as British food. Dialogues were as good as primary school play. The good thing about movie is that it got finished in one part only.

""Adipurush"" is a significant achievement in Indian cinema. I was impressed by the stunning visuals, thrilling action, and Prabhas's outstanding performance as Rama. It's a film that seamlessly blends history and mythology with modern technology, creating an unforgettable experience.However, as someone not well-versed in Indian mythology, I occasionally found it a bit challenging to grasp the story's context. Some supporting characters like Sita and Hanuman seemed to lack the attention they deserved.Overall, ""Adipurush"" is a film worth watching, especially if you enjoy epic storytelling and high-quality production. It's a visual masterpiece that pleases the eye and offers heart-pounding action. While not without its flaws, the film successfully elevates Indian mythology onto the big screen in a grand and captivating manner. I highly recommend watching it, especially if you want to experience the charm and beauty of Indian mythology in a modern epic.

This is the worst representation of the mythology. Bollywood isn't mature enough to craft the great Ramayan. Excessive VFX has overshadowed the core story that's close to everyone's heart.Om Raut, you have forgotten the fundamental essence: the story. Don't introduce unnecessary modern elements and attempt to emulate Hollywood or South Indian films, especially when adapting Ramayan.@prabhas, you are no longer the star/hero we admired, as you failed to represent our true hero. Move past your ""Baahubali"" persona; you're portraying a much grander character in Prabhu Shreeram. It's time to shed your stardom and embrace the depth of your role.Overall, this was a completely failed attempt at adapting the Ramayana. The Ramayana of the 90s by Ramananda Sagar remains an epic that will forever be cherished in our hearts. This recent adaptation doesn't even come close.Filmmakers, don't play with the emotions of the masses.I would give it 0 stars.Jai Shreeram!

Lord Hanuman was well educated and had the knowledge of all the Vedas, he was also a pious scholar. He never used rowdy type words like ""kapda tere baap ka, etc."" He used to wear saffron and yellow loincloth, bracelets on his wrists and ankles, adorned with rudraksh mala alongwith the sacred thread ""janeu"" instead of cheap leather outfit as shown in the movie.What's most irritating is the fact that he's depicted as a timid and childish character who was reluctant to go to Lanka alone at first, gets easily intimidated by Indrajeet and almost defeated by Kumbhakaran in final battle is completely wrong, hence unacceptable.

Bollywood is a joke and these filmmakers are not only just ridiculous they're stupid and brainless. None of the cast is a remote fit to the character.Even before we talk about cast the writers have not done any homework. It's not a movie it's a disaster.Biggest Mistakes:
(1) Ravan eating meat. He was a Brahmin, he abducted Sita only to prove his power.(2) Jatayu did not die right after Ravan injured him.(3) Joke of 10 faces of Ravan.(4) Obscenity in projecting Sita's character in the way of dressing.Just a very wrong movie.

Yes, it is that bad!The acting , the characterization, the direction, the cinematography and don't even get me started on the CGI and VFX- everything is horrendous. At some points it is confusing whether it is a film or a video game.They could have created something so great given how interesting the Ramayan is and all the characters in it are. But instead they created this.

The time when the ravan come to kidnap sita was way diffrent in real ramayan . The pushpak viman was not a big bat .

Now, people might say that the Avatar movie was also filmed in the same way but look at what result James Cameron gave and what has given by Om Rout. Manoj Muntashir is not at all an intelligent author, which he has proved by writing cheap dialogues. Prabhas was never a good actor and will never be. He only shined because of Raja Mauli's efforts.

450,14 August 2023," Hit or Flop Or...

The government can criticize this movie, and the Indian people can become revolted, offended, and whatever else afterward. However, for me, I found this movie completely suitable for all purposes. The primary objective of this movie was to acquaint the upcoming generation with Indian culture and their roots, and I believe the movie succeeded entirely in achieving that goal. This was the underlying theme of the film, and it was executed very effectively, without aiming to offend anyone.The closed-minded perspective of those who criticized this movie (scoring it 3.2 on the scale here) highlights and epitomizes narrow thinking. Of course, I watched the OTT version of the movie, so I didn't find any issue with the dialogues at all. This is because the movie was made in 2023 (released), not like 40 years ago, and we need to move forward with the times while also trying to pass on the culture to the next generation. I believe the creators of this movie were quite successful in doing so.If someone is complaining about the visual effects, then what exactly are Indian audiences expecting? Were they anticipating Avengers-like VFX or Spider-Man or DC-level budgets to enhance the visual effects? Let's be realistic. Most of us Indians grew up with characters like 'Fauladi Singh', 'Shaktimaan', and for the love of these things, let me also mention Indian sci-fi 'blockbusters' like 'Shiva Ka Insaaf', 'Mr. India', and so on. And if we compare that (which is mostly what Indian audiences have been served and embraced) with the effects in this movie, they are quite sophisticated... they are considerably good. So, we can't compare apples and pears. Let's not compare it with a Marvel or DC budget film, but instead, recognize that the producers have gone the extra mile to present us with decent VFX.I'm a sci-fi buff, and I'll say it again, the VFX are pretty okay. Therefore, I don't comprehend why people have criticized this movie. I myself went through the Indian education system, and Ramayan and Mahabharat were part of our curriculum, and I grew up with them as a Hindu. This movie conveys the right message, which I was able to communicate to my kids through their eyes, in the year 2023, where we have access to jet-age technology and AI at our fingertips. So, I must say congratulations to the creators of this movie. Of course, there are some mistakes that I could point out. For example, Ram not hiding behind a tree or obstacle to kill 'Vali', even though that was the case, and not showing when 'Raavan' meets his end, then he praises and honors RAM for showing him the path to salvation, etc. So, some minor details were missing, but to bring an idea as extensive as the Ramayan (which has around seven 'kands') onto the screen in about two and a half hours is an enormous task. In fact, it's so immense that people might not realize the extent of effort required to create something like this and condense it within two and a half or three hours.I think the Indian audience (the majority of viewers of this film have Indian roots) might be better off watching films like 'Pathan' and others of that sort. It's a tragedy that there might never again be quality epic movies made, just because this one was criticized so vehemently & debunked.

RAMANAND TV SERIAL'S are Best. It connects to our soul. I hate adipurush movie. 👎 Ramanand sagar ramayan is best i love till i die. Prabhas & all actors are dumb, they hve watched the movie first. Hiw they liked it. They are cheeter just want to earn money, they hve not any feelings. Dont watch adipurush jyst ban this movie. Ban it from the world. If it released worldwide it makes very bad image of india and history. Our new generation hve very bad image of this.

Horrible movie..! IT is an INSULT to our Sanatan Dharma..! I wish i could give -10 as rating. Director & writers must be jailed for this insulting parody movie..!! SHAMELESS.. It shows RAVAN as a Mughal king.. feeding Red Meat to a huge Bat..!! Ravan a devotee of shiva is throwing Rudraksh away..!! Movie starts with a Harry Potter scene..of few demons suddenly attacking rama , lakshman.& Sita..!! God knows who they were..!! Bramha giving HIRANYAKASHYAP BOON TO RAVAN..! Ravan with Tapori type hair style..! Instead of Golden lanka it's a COAL MINE..!! HORRIBLE roadside tapori dialogue of Hanumanji..! They have made hundreds of mistakes which have nothing to do with original Ramayana.. this movie must be banned!

454,22 July 2023," India's most expensive fail ever
","
In order to make a movie, first of all, you have to turn things over and over in your head, even if it takes long time to do so. Ideas must be clear and understandable. Otherwise, it became an absolute storm of meaningless ideas, which combined together is the perfect example of how to NOT make a movie. Unfortunately, this is exactly what happened with this 179-minutes unbearable attempt-of-a-movie. In the very first place, STOP making movies only for the sake of the fame of an actor, no matter who the actor is. It felt just like it was Prabhas' show throughout the movie, like Raghava got replaced by Prabhas in the mythology. Then, all the actors involved in this 75-million-dollars crash test movie should take acting lessons because even a child can act better than these people performing only for remuneration and fame, even including Prabhas, to my greatest dismay because I liked his acting in Baahubali and Saaho. Speaking of children, I think that the whole VFX were made with drawings made by kindergarten children, like with the depiction of skeletons looking like a personification of Death but are completely cartoonesque instead of being a little bit more ""real"". Even 2015 fantasy children-aimed movie Puli made it better. So I would say that if walking backwards was an Olympics sport, then Adipurush would be a gold medalist. The songs and the music bled my ears, as well as the the images bled my eyes. Watching this movie, we know that the 75 million dollars went directly in Prabhas' and Kriti Shannon's wallet. They were paid for this freak show so they're happy now without even giving a single damn about the quality of this vulgar-language parody of mythological events. Dialogs are completely unbelievable... this is exactly how I imagine discussions between people in that kind of experiment where newborn were put in a house to grow inside and create a new language on their own. Biggest waste ever.

Ram yug was the one everyone was inspired of.We have never seen Ram ji like shown in the picture. We say his face was like everyone get overwhelmed, we say sita mata is the most beautiful lady.For me the cast hired was wrong choice, then the dialogues, if the film has emotions might be it would have worked because Ramayan is not a movie for Indian's it's an emotion.Like we have seen devo ke dev mahadev and Mohit Raina played it soo well with Sonarika Bhadoria as parvati. My god!! It was just a TV show but the cast hired comparing to the image and emotions.I think film makers should not spoil the generation showing Ramayana as a comedy movie.I am not showing any hate for actors they are good but in different role but I believe it Mahesh Babu and Sai pallavi were the actors... this movie was a rock with right choice of dialogues and simplicity.Because there is no need to show Ramayana as trendy and cool and classy. It was simple and it looks good that way only.

Lolz.Excessive use of VFS and animation, everything seems graphic generated. Movie is made neither made for children or adults.I had to take 3 turns to watch this movie (and am a movie buff).

I don't find any objectionable fact whi h is against our religion. Movie is worth watching and It can be seen on International level. Visual effects are also mot that bad. Some reviews are total fake. There should be sone watch on good or bad reviews there should be some authenticity check.I asked many people in theatre they also liked. Because of time limit they showed precised story only. You can't compare it with Ramanand Ramayana as that was very very long with so many episodes. I really like Prabhas as Ram and in the whole movie Jai Shree Ram music is so good to listen. If the movie is so much objectionable people walk out in middle but all were sitting till end.

This movie should be avoided to watch and even to discuss with anyone. Totally disappointed. No emotions, very bad dialogues.. VFX is out of discussion. Nothing is good about this movie.Even the story is not sync. I don't think the writers and director have read/watched ramayan, because if they had, they would have never tried to represent it in such a bad way.Lanka is called ""Soone ki Lanka"". But what we get to watch is black charcoal castles. Even there are no Rakshas, they are represented as Orcs. Seriously?Characters are shown poker faced. Not even a single character is able to justify his/her role in the movie.

Nothing wrong with this movie. It's just us don't want to see it in a new way. Watched it on Netflix and found it was hate sprayed out to this movie only. Dialogues are okay, why to hate so much for it, possibly by the competition. It's so bad that we can be fooled easily now a days by spreading rumours and trusting it blindly.Dark theme through out the movie shows the Ravan's era. Sun raises at the end of Ravan.Fast pace keeps it realistic and simple. Do you still want to see test match of 5 days, if no then why to yell.It's an art, so look at it as it.Movie was kept simple and easy for this generation.Watch it.

Utter waste movie, third class actors, third class director and dialogue writer. The visual effects appear amateurish and poorly executed. The cinematography and editing fail to create a visually appealing or cohesive experience. Even the soundtrack, which should enhance the emotions and atmosphere, falls short in delivering anything memorable or impactful. The lackluster storytelling, weak performances, and subpar technical execution make it difficult to recommend. Despite the hype surrounding the film, it fails to deliver on its promises, leaving viewers feeling let down and disinterested. With its numerous flaws and lack of quality, it's no exaggeration to describe ""Adipurush"" as a garbage movie that falls far below expectations.

If you had hoped for Bollywood reproducing some Avengers + Planet of the Apes + Lord of the Rings type scenes, this is an attempt (bad rip off like, but an attempt nevertheless). If you had hoped for Bahubali by Bollywood, maybe an attempt too (average, at best). But, if you had hoped for a solid attempt at recreation of Ramayana with some great visual effects, this isn't it. Actually it is just simply bad when it comes to dialogues (uncouth, distasteful, crass at times), storyline (God knows which Ramayana this is), or the cast (except, maybe, Saif Ali Khan). It could have been so much. So so much actually. But but but - it is poorly done.Ramayana's is a storyline so elegant, it is probably very hard to spoil it. Forget the religious aspect for once even - the literature and the storyline itself is superb, and it flows. Amazingly, these fellas managed to royally break that script apart too. I mean, how?Dialogues in some instances are going to make you almost puke. No seriously, they will.Also - Ravana is a Bat- (controlling) -man, riding a bat instead of Pushpak, which is there in the movie, just not used by Ravana. Apparently, Ravana prefers bat-rides. Speaking of. Indrajeet / Meghnad is Flash morphed with Doctor Strange. I mean they could have stuck to either of Marvel or DC, at least!!I can go on. I won't.2 stars cos I love superhero movies.

Om Raut needs his head examined by a psychiatrist, he wanted to remake Lord of the Rings, why?????????????? Lord of the Rings is awesome, but Ramayana is so much original than that movie. Om Raut and team, and whoever the writer butchered the story. Such people should be banned from Bollywood. By mistake I went to see it in a theatre, our family was the only one besides 2 more people. This guy had an opportunity and a massive budget that he could have highlighted and taken Ramayana to the masses in the world. But he was on weed and disillusioned, he deformed the real story made everything modern - this is not a house remake dodo. Ravana's palace was beautiful not black, he never rode a bat. All the characters missed to impress, none of the characters showed emotions, Kriti Sanon tried her best on the worst movie of her career. There were no dialogs, the story line did not even have a flow. The costumes were bland, the actors were bland. Do not see this MOVIE even if it's free.

1 starIt is absolutely pathetic how they ruined an epic just like it's no big deal. Serious lack of conviction is aptly visible in this doomed project.I couldn't believe why they would release such kind of a product. If the young minds of today get their understanding of Valmiki Ramayana from this movi
Within the first few minutes of the movie, it became clear that the film was going to be a massive letdown. The portrayal of key characters like Lord Rama, Sita, and Ravana was completely inaccurate and absurd. The use of apes instead of monkeys, the portrayal of Lanka as dark and black, and the creatures supporting Ravana all seemed like attempts to modernize the story in a cheap and disrespectful way.

Never have I ever wanted to leave the cinema hall before the movie is finished. I have never seen something soo awful that made me want to give negative rating. This film is a joke at best. I don't know how this movie is not boycotted yet after insulting every character in one of the most epic story of all time.Don't waste your hard earned money on this. Read the reviews and share them. The creators are earning money because of us. I want them to be demoralized to such extent that they regret making this movie.This is a message to all future directors who wants to make similar movies. Do your research and cast the characters based on their performance and not their popularity.Even if someone watch this movie without having any prior knowledge about Ramayan, this movie does a horrible job at introducing the characters. 3 Hours is a lot of time and they had plenty of time to give characters some basic introductions and depth. If a non hindu or someone with no knowledge about the story watches this movie. They WILL NEVER KNOW... THAT SHRI RAM AND LAXMAN ARE SUPPOSED TO BE BROTHERS. And, that says a lot about the movie.

Dear Adipurush Team, you can learn so many thing Demon Slayer Animation Team. That VFX is the worst, I think Fresher also can do better than this movie. The story you fully messed up. Even cartoon series will feel shame if they watch your movie.If I forget about religion then also this is a third-class movie. I think the dialogue is written by Chapri MC stan. No seriously? But somehow based on earnings your film will declare a hit movie. Just my thoughts, current in India religion became a top priority over Jobs, education and health safety. And you thought if make any Hindu mythology story it will be a super supper hit.

Well I was very excited about this movie but all my excitement just vanished when i saw this movie in the cinema hall. Let me talk about the bad: 1) Dialogues are very painful. The dialogues of Hanuman ji was very dirty. 2) The costumes were very unsorted. Why was Lord Ram wearing a leather sandal? 3) This is the VFX? Very sorry to say but I think the makers didn't care about the VFX. Just lots and lots of CGIs been played as monkeys. 4) And yes why was Ravana riding a bat? A freaking bat! Yet he had his Pushpak Viman. 5) Who told you that Lord Ram, Lakshman and Sita were living in a cave? 6) Who told you that Shabri came to lord Ram as Lord Ram came to Shabri. 7) Sunny SIngh's dialogues were very shabby. I think he had been kept awaken from a month. 8) Pathetic sceneries! Who told Om Raut that Lanka was made of coal? It does not mean that you just show some lines of gold on those stupid black coal kilns? 9) So the main point, who told Om Raut to omit half of the Ramayana? Where is Sursa and Hanuman's clash? Where is Ahiravana and Hanuman's Clash? Where is the Sampati and Hanuman's conversation and yet also who told Om Raut that Lord Brahma gave the boon to Lankesh? It was Bhole baba not Brahma. 10) WHat the hell how can Ravana act like Sanjay Dutt? 11) How can Ravana give his pet bat meat as he was a Brahmin son (Vishrava's son)? 12) How can you show Vibhishana's wife as an item woman? A low cut blouse like a candy? WTF! 13) How can you show Indrajeet as Flash? Like seriously? That Tarzen the wonder car wala actor? 14) Final thing - lots of misconceptions! Somewhere Sunny Singh as Lakshmana called Shri Rama as bhai and somewhere as Bhaiya but yet I loved how Prabhas just owned his dialogues. Sharad Kelkar nailed it! Okay So I love how Ravana was dressed. Not only this, the cut after his veena play, his dialogues were amazing. At some points i love the VFX but mostly not! The calling of the brahmhastra by Lord Ram VFX both the time was just amazing. The acting of Kriti Sanon was good. Overall the movie is a disaster. If you want to save your money just don't watch this movie. I have just gave this movie 5 star due to its music, somewhere good VFX and Ravana and Sita's dialogues.

471,19 June 2023," Adipurush: A Disappointing Adaptation of a Revered Epic
","
Adipurush, directed by Om Raut, falls short of expectations as it attempts to condense the vast episodes of the mythological epic into a three-hour movie. The overly tight plot sacrifices crucial storytelling elements, resulting in a fragmented and confusing narrative that fails to do justice to the original story.The storyline of Adipurush had to solely revolve around the abduction of Maa Sita by Ravana and Lord Rama's subsequent efforts to rescue her with the help of Hanuman and his followers. Unfortunately, the movie neglects to establish a cohesive track of events, leaving audiences feeling disconnected and bewildered. The lack of attention to the ""how"" and ""what"" aspects of the story further compounds the issue, leaving viewers craving a deeper exploration of the characters and their motivations.Despite boasting a talented cast, Adipurush disappointingly underutilizes and misrepresents its ensemble. The potential of the actors remains largely untapped, resulting in shallow and unconvincing character portrayals. It is disheartening to witness such a group of performers not being given the opportunity to shine.The dialogues in Adipurush drastically fail to evoke the emotional depth and resonance expected from a mythological epic. The writing feels loose and uninspired, lacking the power to truly engage the audience. The dialogues are a missed opportunity to connect with the viewers on a deeper level and leave them emotionally invested in the story.The usage of technology in Adipurush is a significant letdown. Rather than enhancing the movie, it appears to detract from the overall experience. The execution of the visual effects and other technological elements feels forced and out of place, detracting from the authenticity and charm of the story.In conclusion, Adipurush is a disappointing adaptation of a revered epic. The overly tight plot, lack of a coherent storyline, underutilized cast, weak dialogues, and mishandled technology all contribute to a subpar cinematic experience. With a rating of one star out of ten, it is difficult to recommend this movie to anyone seeking a faithful and immersive retelling of the Ramayana.

Detailed Review: A question to the director and the other heads, how can you be so irresponsible while making this masterpiece of a story into something trash? The blatant disregard for retaining the original character personalities is appalling. Ravan, a Brahmin devotee of Shiv, known for his vegetarianism, is completely transformed in this movie, which not only disrespects the original mythology but also has the potential to hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus.Let's talk about the VFX, or rather the lack thereof. Despite having a higher budget than Brahmastra, Adipurush fails to achieve even a fraction of the visual effects quality. It's clear that more effort should have been put into fixing the VFX instead of just superficially color grading the scenes.The dialogues in Adipurush reach new depths of mediocrity. While attempting to portray a more modern interpretation, the filmmakers fail to put in the necessary effort to create dialogues that can be understood and appreciated by any generation. The result is a disjointed and poorly crafted script that leaves viewers cringing and yearning for substance.In conclusion, my disappointment with Adipurush is immeasurable, and it truly ruined my day. The film's disregard for character authenticity, subpar VFX, and atrocious dialogues render it an abysmal cinematic experience. It fails to deliver on its promise of an engaging and respectful adaptation of the revered Ramayan Epic. It serves as a disservice to both the source material and the audience, leaving a bitter taste in the mouths of those who had hoped for so much more.

Huge figurine of Ravana as a demon... The real characters in their form as monkey or bear ... Names preferred brings a refresher apart from the age old names called. The actors were Truely matchable to the characters. Some incidences were known by the movie. Super direction.. a treat to eyes...!

And it has the worst VFX and the making of the film was also copied like the lanka was copied from Asgard ( marvel creations ).It is very shameful. A film was made on our Ramayana by japan and it was animated so good and beautiful but Indian government banned it. I can't imagine Ramayana made by japan was better then the film made by our director even after the Ramayana made by japan was animated.

How many basic facts did they get wrong? Why does Lord Ram sound like a cross from Salman Bhai and overhyped priest? Where is the genuineness in him? And all of these questions were in the 15 minutes? Also wth is up with the demons in the first scene? Even Harry Potter fought better dementors than them!!! Lankan citizens look like ogres from Lord of the Rings!! To the director a simple message: know your audience, know what they know, use better CGI and make good use of Prabhas (we've all seen Bahubali)

Making fun of God in films has become a common thing these days.. Ramayana is a great saga and we should respect it unitedly. Our coming generation needs to know that Shri Ram is a very great personality and should take inspiration from his life .. The government should ban movies made on religion......jai shree ram..

479,10 July 2023," An insult to our Culture
","
This movie is not only a very cheap insult to our culture but one.of the worst movies to ever be made in India.Ramayana is something sacred, we've heard the story hundreds of times and nothing shocked and disappointed me personally than this horrible rendition of it. It managed to not only shock and offend Hindus but Muslims and Christians as well.I can't believe how low this movie is and how low and cheap the directors mindset was while he released this disaster upon us
He even had the gall to blame everyone but himself when he got negative criticism.I have no more words, just watch it yourself and hopefully you won't be disgusted or traumatised.

The film revolves around the legendary tale of Lord Rama and his epic battle against the formidable demon king Ravana. Director Om Raut weaves together a compelling narrative that stays true to the essence of the original myth while adding his own creative flair. The screenplay strikes a perfect balance between staying faithful to the source material and offering fresh interpretations, making the story accessible to both fans of Hindu mythology and newcomers alike.One of the film's biggest strengths lies in its exceptional visual effects and production design. The grandeur of the sets, intricate costumes, and awe-inspiring landscapes transport viewers into a world that feels both mythical and tangible. The action sequences are masterfully choreographed, showcasing epic battles and breathtaking stunts that will leave you on the edge of your seat. The visual effects seamlessly blend with the live-action, creating a truly immersive experience .Prabhas delivers a captivating performance as Lord Rama, capturing the essence of the revered deity with his commanding presence and emotional depth. Saif Ali Khan, in the role of Ravana, brings a mesmerizing intensity and complexity to the screen, making him a compelling antagonist.Adipurush"" is a spectacular cinematic masterpiece that seamlessly blends myth and modern filmmaking. With its breathtaking visuals, stellar performances, and compelling storytelling, it captivates from start to finish.

","
There is always some creative liberty that should be allowed to an artist. It allows space for growth and quality to nurture. However, in this case, con artists Muntashir and Raut have taken incredible liberty to attend to only one fundamental cause, i.e. To make easy buck by exploiting the public image and sentiment woven over the sacred figure of Lord Ram, using the ready made story of Epic Ramayan and corrupting it with uncouth language and gestures, unnecessary and poorly done graphics, abysmally poor direction, poor choice of actors, extremely blend acting and screenplay. The only thing acceptable is the music. But that can be accessed through other means, no need to waste money on a shoddy film. The team is likely to face legal action soon for making a uncouth parody out of a sacred story and deluding public by advertising on the story of Ramayan in the pre release publicity, while taking a complete U-turn later and claiming that the movie is not ramayan but an adaptation of its story. This is a scam of hundreds of crores and must be punished both by legal means as well as by not contributing to footfall in theatres. Overall, a horrible movie and a short sighted attempt to make an easy business by abusing the popularity and sanctity of a religious story and then going overboard with poor direction, script and screenplay to bring total disgrace to it! The duo may have thought they will get away with it easily, but such heinous attempts to fool the public and make money off their sentiments will soon be taken up in the court! This movie has also shown how good actors like Prabhas can be turned into cartoons by immature cartoon directors like Om Raut.. to put it in a single phrase, this movie has proven to be a historic disappointment!

This is one of the best film that I have watched in my life. Prabhas as in Raghav, Kriti as in Janaki and Saif as Lankesh are one of the best. I liked the presentation of the movie, especially the VFX, CGI characters, realistic animations and backgrounds and creatively spoken dialogues. Also the movie gears up with the music. Jai Shri Ram and Shivoham are loud music special songs. Rama siya Ram touching heart. Direction is of best and top quality. No one in whole film industry including Hollywood and Bollywood can make such movie. Hats off to Om Raut for gifting us such a great movie. Go to theatre and Enjoy the movie.

From the beginning the movie takes a different route way away from divine Ramayana storyline.If you are a Ram bhakt, stay away from it.The actors selection and caricature is so wrong that the one who played Ram looks like Ravan, Ravan looks like Marichi and Hanuman looks like Wali..
Many scenes are objectionable.For example shabari, Ram meeting with Hanuman, Ram being pulled down by Ravana, tattu Indrajeet, gorillas as wali and Sugriva which are Vanar. All actors have cold expressions. The dialogues are roadside rowdy ones.Ramayan is a divine story of dharma, bhakti, obedient son, husband and many aspects.These guys have attempted to make a video gameish war movie with zero script.In fact, It should be banned.Stay away.

They have been taking an undue advantage of tolerant behavior of Hindu people & now this has to be stopped.Hope film will be banned in all state soon.

Adipurush is a decent movie despite all paid/unpaid negativity. More focused on visuals and tactics, a bit less on soul and character development than desired . Script, dialogues, characters are all good and thoughtful.Dialogues are short and not preachy. Ram should speak less not more because he is ""Maryada Purushotam"" or restrained personality unlike Ramanand Sagar's Ram etched in public's memory.Special effects should be subtle and invisible. Not loud and pronounced. Your mind and eyes should not come to know that they have been cheated. Script, content, emotions, soul, connection, feelings... will rule movie making forever. Then comes subtle quiet invisible special effects.

To prepare for Gandhiji's role, Ben Kinngsley not only studied newsreel footage of Gandhi to adopt his mannerisms and gait but also lost weight and practiced yoga. He even learnt to spin thread just as Gandhi did. Same preparation was needed to depict mannerism and character of maryda pursottam Ram .. picture was made in a hurry without any research actor didn't prepared for the roles they were playing.

I am not a professional film critic, but #Adipurush is so disappointing, it felt like makers had very little to no knowledge about the story or the characters. Scenes were rushed as it's impossible to even just the battle in one movie. It was poorly researched and poorly made. There were many mistakes, or I should say the whole film was a one big mistake. As a fan of prabhas and being a hindu, I was really looking forward to this movie but it just made me disappointed with almost everything. Only thing that was good in the movie was background music. Ramayan by Ramanand Sagar was far way better than this one. It's an humble request please don't make such bad movies on stories that matter the crores of people across the globe.

The overall script doesn't make sense. Language user is offensive. And events are not in place. For eg., Ram Setu involved a curse not the will of the sea. While only two person placed stones for ram Setu, in the movie everyone placed stones 😂. I don't this movie makes sense to anyone who has watched and grownup with their grandparent and read any of the scriptures. The movie writers I believe were someone's favorite and because of that no one checked the facts and consulted scholars. Now we can argue that they referred a text but then they should release their sources until then it's going to be 1 star.

This movie is based on ramayan clearly. The Adhipurush film makers are may be trying something new but they should understand this is a religion believe. And every religion stories are full of knowledge and every moment has a deep meaning. They change this meanings by changing the scenes and dialogues. Mostly dialogue are very bad you should understand what you are showing about a respectful charector like Hanuman ji. So the most bad things for me is dialogue and some scenes they showed. And the only good thing is the songs. That is good. They showed leather jacket armer on lord Ram's body and Hanuman's body. They showed Ravan who was a bramhan he was giving meat by his hand.

My dear the most stupid Director,I sincerely advise you not to defame the Holy Puranas and also not to decharacterise Sri Ram.Before releasing such stupid movies in future depicting the characters, pls have a proper insight. We would sincerely request you to watch Sri Ramanand Sagar's Ramayan before portraying Sri Ram, Mata Sita, Sri Lakshman, Veer Hanuman and Raavan before portraying their characters.I should say that you have converted the epic heroes a comical character and you yourselves have proved to be a joker. Not minding you being a joker...but we strongly oppose of you having converted the epic heroes comical characters.Bollywood always have artists like you who always are in the run to defame the medium which fills the heart of the audience, and your plate.Continue this, and i guarantee you the fall of the same in no time.Crew involved in the whole bogus, remember that you are representing to the world the culture of our country. I don't give a damm whether you defame the culture, but when it comes to the country, it is disappropriate and misleading.Dear Protagonists involved, I congratulate you heartily for the fall you are going to face in your career. Sad to see that all of you were in the golden phase of your jobs, and it within no time, for satisfying limited needs of someone, and yours, you put what made you, at stake.Really ashamed, and surprised to see how you joined hands with these idiots to pull such a ruckus, where note that initially while starting the same only you were involved, but now it has come to the point that, the whole of India is being defamed. It is really painful to see that you people have contributed to humiliate our own Epic Heroes like this..SHAME ON YOU.... UTTER SHAME ON YOU!!!!!!Can't see a difference between the measures taken by the Early So-Called Patriots(British Agents) and you, in misleading the youth and driving away from their culture.Hope that the money meal served in your plate, helps you assuade your hunger.

Pro: Brought the entire nation together. Together, to express disappointment.Con: The whole product.It takes a special kind of talent to misinterpret, no let me correct myself, disregard entire texts that have been part of the culture for many, many centuries. Makers say this was made for the youth, and by marketing the product like this, the makers continue to belittle the youth of the nation. The youth of this nation knows better, and deserves better still. Makers must be held accountable for this blunder and must publicly apologize for hurting national sentiment. The writer needs to stop trying to defend his role in this blunder, and the director (the real perpetrator behind the final product) must grow a spine and step out in the public view and apologize.1. Minimal or zero attention to details.2. Minimal or zero effort to give justice to character development.3. Minimal or zero research of the texts.4. Minimal or zero intellectual value in interpreting what creative liberty is and how much it should be exploited when making a film on such a crucial story.5. Minimal or zero effort in adapting the screenplay, from an already well established story.6. Minimal or zero respect for the art.7. Minimal or zero spiritual investment in the project.Overall, I might just lean more towards saying ""zero"", over saying ""minimal"".Every single person that has been involved in this project is at fault. The final product is abysmal, right from the casting to the designs to the makers to the execution. This ""piece of art"" makes you realise how long a minute actually is, because every second of it is a torture, like a needle being bore into your being extremely slowly and meticulously.Extremely poor characterization of every character in the film. Pathetic attempt at writing dialogues. Disgusting execution in terms of set designs, VFX, costumes. Not one element of the film can be appreciated, and yes, I do mean it. Good songs, or might I say just the one or two ""Shree Ram"" songs, do not compensate the overly pathetic final result. The two good songs must be enjoyed over any music app of your choice.The business of the movie has been freefalling ever since the word of mouth spread, it's only right if the freefall comes to a sudden halt by a complete crash of the film. Because that is what the product and its makers deserve. Every person involved in this product must apologise, and own up to their faults instead of trying to continually defend their actions.Regards.

Basically The Director Has made a worst movie having the wrong concept and this movie has suffered heavily due to poor word of mouth. And the scene and the character of every actor is disgusting and vulgar even The Ram is Looking like Jesus 😤 and some of the part the Lanka Shown in Adipurush is Black the wrong Things i even scene the Character used to and the VFX are glitchly sometimes It's better to give 500 cr. To Marvel and they give you best VFX created scenes. And the dressing sense of every role is just another direction Modernism
Better Don't Watch this movie and Saves your money and feed some Needy people instead to buy ticket.

Or you deserve more than Oscar award. Oscar awards is not sufficient for you guys because you guys won my heart. Thanks to Om and Manoj sir. You two showed courage to release this movie to give nice message to people of our country. You showed today's ground level problems of india through this movie. You did work for public cause. You are noble piece prize winners for me. My soul liked your story and your performance. Siya var ram chandra ki jai.

This movie was made for only two purposes
1. Business - earn money from devotees in the name of religion. At first they said it was based on Ramayana, and now after all negativity they are saying its not adapted from Ramayana. How quickly they changed their statements. They have hurt millions of people's sentiments.2. To alter and make fun of history. They have included their own version of so many things, so many times that it really seems funny after some time. Dialogues are changes, scenes are changed, facts are changed and what not.Even after all this mess, makers still don't want to accept their mistake. Pathetic.

Such a inspiring story murdered by this movie. Poor direction, poor story telling, poor dialogues and poor acting. Story was sidelined and focus was given only on special effects. Even special effects were poor. A failed attempt to copy Hollywood movies. Acting of Saif Ali Khan was poor. It is hard to understand casting him as Ravaan. My high hopes from the movie was crushed. Producers should have made an animation movie. I think they tried to copy Marvel movies and gave everyone some or other superpower. One of worst adaptation of the Ramayan. Even they failed in make-up & costume.Save your time & money & do not watch this movie.

I happened to watch adipurush on first day and half way through I left the theatre mainly because even though my mind says continue to watch due to prabhas but heart says this wrong !!One question to makers of this movie including workers involved, none of you feel that it's wrong while making movie ? Do you feel happy when kids of next generation think Ramayan is just about normal human beings of past who pose with modern hair cut and language of current times does it. It alter history ? You have used clever names to characters like Raghav, Seshu and Janaki etc.

521,26 June 2023," Adipurush: A Disastrous Mythological Mess
","
Adipurush, the highly anticipated mythological extravaganza, promises an epic retelling of a classic tale. However, this film falls miserably short of expectations, delivering a convoluted narrative with a collection of painfully bad dialogues and a misguided story that leave the audience scratching their heads in disbelief.The screenplay, or rather, the lack thereof, fails to establish a coherent plotline. Adipurush jumps haphazardly from one scene to another, leaving no room for character development or emotional investment. The pacing is erratic, veering between slow-motion sequences that feel like they're stuck in molasses and hyperactive action scenes that lack any sense of purpose or direction. It's a baffling mess that feels like it was edited together by a toddler with a pair of blunt scissors.But the real downfall of Adipurush lies in its dialogue. The lines uttered by the characters are so cringe-worthy and devoid of depth that it's hard not to burst into laughter during serious moments. The attempts at grandeur and profundity fall flat, as the characters spew out lines that sound like they were lifted from a cheap fantasy novel written by an angsty teenager. The dialogue is peppered with clichés and nonsensical metaphors that make you question the sanity of the screenwriters.The performances in Adipurush do little to salvage the train wreck of a script. The actors seem lost and confused, delivering their lines with an awkwardness that borders on painful to watch. Even the usually reliable and charismatic lead actor fails to bring any semblance of life to his character. It's as if the entire cast was given a sedative before filming, resulting in lackluster performances that add to the overall disappointment of the movie.Furthermore, the visual effects, which were touted as one of the film's strengths, are underwhelming and often distractingly artificial. The CGI feels unfinished and poorly integrated into the scenes, making it difficult to suspend disbelief and immerse oneself in the story. What should have been awe-inspiring battles between gods and demons end up looking like a subpar video game cutscene.In the end, Adipurush is a misguided attempt at creating an epic mythological film that falls flat on its face. The bad dialogue, muddled story, and uninspired performances make for a painful viewing experience. It's a shame that such a promising concept was wasted on this mess of a movie. Save your time and money, and look elsewhere for a worthwhile cinematic experience.Adipurush fails to capture the essence of the mythological tale it aims to depict. Instead, it offers a disjointed narrative that lacks depth and fails to engage the audience. The screenplay lacks coherence and jumps between scenes without providing any meaningful connection. It feels like a random assortment of events rather than a well-crafted story.One of the most glaring issues with Adipurush is its dialogue. The lines are cringe-inducing and lack any semblance of artistry. The characters' exchanges are filled with clichés and forced metaphors, making them sound shallow and unconvincing. It's as if the writers tried to create grandiose moments but ended up with a series of awkward and laughable exchanges instead.The performances in Adipurush do little to elevate the weak script. The actors appear lost and disconnected from their characters, delivering their lines with a lack of conviction. Even the talented lead actor fails to inject life into his role, leaving the audience disinterested and disconnected from the story. It's disheartening to see such a talented cast underutilized and wasted in a film that does not allow them to shine.Visually, Adipurush falls short of its promised spectacle. The CGI effects, which were expected to be a highlight, are unimpressive and poorly executed. The visual elements feel artificial and detached from the world of the film, making it difficult to suspend disbelief and immerse oneself in the story. The battles between gods and demons lack the grandeur and awe-inspiring quality they should have possessed, leaving the audience underwhelmed.In conclusion, Adipurush is a disappointing film that fails to deliver on its promises. The misguided story, filled with bad dialogue and weak performances, leaves the audience disconnected and disinterested. The lackluster visual effects further contribute to the overall disappointment. It's a missed opportunity to bring a beloved mythological tale to life in a captivating and engaging manner. Save your time and seek out a better cinematic experience elsewhere.

This is what happens when a filmmaker does not understand the soul of the story. Bollywood filmmakers have forgotten that there is a beauty in simplicity. Most of them are busy in trying to recreate Bahubali and superheroes movies that they have completely turned blind eye to good storytelling.An epic story like Ramayan which is well known for its target audience, yet the dumb team thought they could make completely different version which will be loved. There is a reason that Ramayan is loved for thousand of years. Don't think that your puny mind can outdo that.Direction, screenplay, action, vfx, story, custome, art direction, acting, choice of actors/actresses, dialogues and everything else is just a big disappointment.

I hope the younger generation doesn't watch this movie.... They've shown a story in which they've mostly glorified Ravan sena ...... No mention of astr use by Shri Ram......no mention of Angad's story......No mention of the pushpak viman.....and many more such things.Please don't let your kids watch this movie.Cultural Sensitivity: One of the main concerns about ""Adipurush"" is how it handles the cultural and religious sensitivities associated with the source material, the Ramayana. Some critics argue that adapting such a revered epic into a commercial film risks diluting its spiritual and moral teachings for the sake of entertainment.Historical Accuracy: The movie, like many adaptations of mythological stories, may take artistic liberties with the source material for dramatic effect. This can lead to inaccuracies in portraying the characters, events, and themes of the original epic. Critics might argue that altering the story could potentially misrepresent the core messages of the Ramayana.Commercialization of Religion: Some critics view ""Adipurush"" as an example of the commercialization of religious narratives. By turning a sacred story into a big-budget film, there's a concern that the primary focus could shift from the spiritual and ethical aspects of the epic to profit-making.Casting Choices: The casting decisions for the film have also come under scrutiny. The choice of actors for iconic characters can significantly impact the perception of the adaptation. Critics might question whether the chosen actors can authentically capture the essence of characters like Lord Rama, Sita, and Ravana.

Anyway valmiki has written a twisted story about the whole Ram Ravan story biased to Indians and now this ridiculous adhipurush to fuel hatred towards Ravan? And apparently Ram is fighting with dementors too? And Ravan is riding a bat, with an army of bats. Did you replace Ravan with Dracula? 😂 The VFX team couldn't even come up with something close to Pushpaka Vimana that they made Ravan ride a bat. Overall the movie is ridiculously stupid.JFYI - The historians who have studied the matter have proven that Seetha was Ravan's daughter who was abandoned by the royal family as the astrologers have predicted that this daughter's existence would bring an untimely death to the father. That's how king Janaka finds her and adopts her. Moreover, at the end of the Rama Ravana battle, when seetha was asked to do the Agni pariksha to prove her virginity, seetha uses the same chant taught by Ravan, to not be burnt by the fire. However, her existence did cause an untimely death to Ravan just like the respective astrologers predicted.

Chota Bhim and many local cartoons graphics are far more better than this movie's graphics.Can't get more disappointed than this...

Very bad acting, very bad casting for the wrong roles, and very bad plot. The movie is a disgrace, disrespect, a tarnish and an insult to Maharishi Valmiki Ji and his account of Ramayana. Not only does it not stick to the normal, traditional story of the Ramayana, but somehow attempts to create its own. It mocks Sanatanis all over India by misrepresenting it with such awful storyline. Simply speaking in Shudh Hindi and dressing traditionally does not make it an accurate representation of Ramayana, Shri Rama's tale, or even broadly, the premise of Sanatana Dharma. The special effects are awful, truly awful. It truly makes it feel like you're watching a low-budget film, rather than being immersed in the actual story, because it's so off-putting. Unlike movies like Interstellar, where the choreography and special effects make you immersed until you get goosebumps, this was a complete failure. Stay away from the movie, please. Keep your sanity. I recommend people read the real Ramayana story, or watch the Ramayana show by Ramanand Sagar Ji, than watch this garbage. Jai Shri Rama 🚩

You should watch this movie,
Dont know why people are criticising this movie.People are comparing this 3 hour movie with 80 episodes of Ramayana by Ramanand's Sagar.Why people want to see same characters?, in this modern era characters appearance improvised in this movie.I think people should appreciate this indigenously made movie.I was about to cancel this movie ticket but fortunately I thought to watch it, & shockingly its not that bad people are portraying it is becoz of poor VFX and appearance .I believe VFX are the comparable with hollywood and its very good.You watch it and then decide but don't just relay on views on social media. 😀

Everything you can imagine can be bad about a movie is here and there is absolutely no reason why this should have ever been made unless the producers wanted to burn cash which they could have very well done rather than creating this pukefest of a movie.It's absolute garbage from the 1st scene and just keeps on taking from you and insulting cinema with each frame. Trust me I want to erase the memory of the movie but I know it's going to haunt me for the rest of my life (till I suffer from Alzheimer's). I would be thankful when that happens.How does such a movie get commissioned, who decides the screenplay...how do actors agree to star in such movies...can't imagine what kind of people were behind this movie (may be they are laughing at me cause I didn't get the joke).Stay as far away from this movie if you don't want to scar your cinematic memory with such trash.

Firstly, I am not a Ram worshipper or Hindu. However, I still like the Ramayana story a lot. Therefore this review will be a little less emotionally charged than the others. I believe in accepting all and varied perspectives on a topic.""Adipurush"" is a modern retelling of the ancient Sanskrit ballad Ramayana, which is an important text of Hindu scripture. The story of the Ramayana is essentially a love story- between Prince Ram, an incarnation of the god Vishnu, and his wife Princess Sita, herself an incarnation of Vishnu's consort Lakshmi. The ballad contains various discussions on moral and philosophical themes, interwoven throughout the narrative.""Adipurush"" makes some decent attempts at adapting the story for a modern audience, but fails miserably in several aspects. For one, the CGI and visual effects are terrible. There are multiple sequences where the computer graphics are painfully obvious. Some of the shot compositions and cinematography was pretty great though. The fruit of those 600 crores are barely visible.I like the stylised and simple designs of all the costumes, weapons and characters. Unfortunately, keeping a few key details accurate (such as giving Ram and Lakshman yellow trousers instead of white) would have been good. Additionally, it is ideal for fantasy and mythological characters to have long hair rather than shorter hairstyles that resemble modern looks, which takes you really far away from the world of the film. The ""Rakshasas"" or demons are given fades and Mohawks which do not suit the world of ""Adipurush"" at all.Similar issues such as featuring gorillas in the monkey tribe and depicting Lanka (Ravana's kingdom) as sooty black (as opposed to the beautiful city of gold as described in the original story) are present as well. The ballad describes Sita as giving her head brooch (which Ram placed on her on their wedding night) to Hanuman as a token to take back to him, but she gives one of her bracelets to the mighty monkey god instead.The screenplay is written not for a general audience, but for people who know the story of the Ramayana really well. As a result, several of the character motivations are unclear (or even missing) and characters lack development or depth. The film should have, in my opinion, been a two-parter like Mani Ratnam's ""Ponniyin Selvan"", with the first half describing the birth of Ram and Sita, followed by their love story, Kaikeyi's (Ram's stepmother) machinations against Ram and his exile to the forest. The second half should have focused on Sita's kidnapping by Ravana and her subsequent rescue by Ram, Lakshman and the monkeys and bears.One does not get a real sense of Ram's character or Ravana's corruption. Hanuman, Ravana and Meghnad (Ravana's son) seem to have been done dirty the most in the screenplay. Sita is done some justice though. Poor Lakshman is tremendously under-utilised.For some reason, the characters of Ram, Sita, Lakshman and Hanuman are never called by those names, but Ravana and everyone else is called by their own names. The songs feature the names ""Ram"" and ""Siya (another form of the name ""Sita"")"", but the characters are called ""Raghav"" and ""Janaki"" instead. The depictions of other divine beings in the Hindu pantheon is pretty disrespectful (the most prominent example being Brahma, who has to literally refer to himself as such in the movie- there is otherwise no way you can tell that it's Brahma).The epic describes the monkey physician Sushena as the one who heals Lakshman from a deadly wound inflicted on him by Meghnad. However, a seemingly new character created for the film- Vibhishan's (Ravana's younger brother who takes Ram's side during the war) wife is the one who heals Lakshman. There was a brief shot of her cleavage during an expository scene, which seems to have been removed for the OTT release. Some controversial bits of dialogue have also been dubbed over in the latest cut of the film. Odd additions to the story include a massive dragon that Ravana uses to fly around in and Meghnad having what seems to be super speed.I found myself appreciating the film more on my second watch. Even though Prabhas was miscast as Ram, I think he did a decent job in the role. Unfortunately, it felt a bit too much like Amarendra Baahubali. Kriti Sanon gave a beautiful performance as Sita and played the character with great conviction and grace. Devdutta Nage and Sunny Singh need to take some acting classes. Saif Ali Khan is a beast of an actor, but the script did him no justice. Not to mention the terrible design for the character's looks.A few sequences look pretty great- most notably the romantic scenes with Ram and Sita, as well as the scene where the monkeys construct the floating bridge (Ram Setu). I felt those scenes were done pretty well. Everything else looked amateur, sometimes even trash.The final battle felt incredibly lacklustre. A lot of the shots seems to have been lifted straight from other movies, including Prabhas' ""Baahubali"", the first ""Avengers"" film and ""Lord of The Rings"". This is disheartening to see as someone who has seen older adaptations of the Ramayana legend that had some amazing original sequences and shots that still induce chills today.Perhaps the only saving grace of the film is the music. The songs by Ajay-Atul are great to listen to, but seem detached from the visuals when they appear during the movie. The background score does most of the heavy lifting for selling the epic nature of the story.All in all, I felt that the film had great potential, but it was extremely disappointing. The movie fails to appeal to the modern audience it desperately craves for and does not respect the source material to even a serviceable degree. I do not recommend this film if you want to learn about Indian history or religion, or even if you want to watch a non-Hollywood fantasy film. You could watch this just to kill some time though.I would recommend the following series and films to get a better idea of the Ramayana story:1. Ramanand Sagar's ""Ramayan"" (1987 Hindi TV series)
2. NDTV's ""Ramayan"" (2008 Hindi TV series)
3. Bapu's ""Sampoorna Ramayanam"" (1972 Telugu film)
4. Bapu's ""Seetha Rama Kalyanam"" (1976 Telugu film)
5. Yugo Sako and Ram Mohan's ""Ramayana: The Legend of Prince Ram"" (1992 English/Hindi animated film)

537,5 September 2023," Adipurush: The Ultimate Lesson in Massacring a Film With Immense Potential

Adipurush is an extremely tame adaptation of the Ramayana, one of the greatest ancient Indian epics. It is a film that does not seem to take itself too seriously and sacrifices logic at the altar of excesses. It is excruciatingly long and painfully slow in the way it pans out. While the length of the film is not necessarily a bad thing, the bemusing storyline and the extremely bland characters ensure that the film is an unintentionally hilarious snooze-fest. It is a comedy of errors which only goes from bad to worse. The film operates in extremes, with characters such as Ravana being the epitome of murderous evil without any redeeming quality whatsoever. The other characters too are, unfortunately, devoid of any impact, with multiple key characters being entirely left out of the film.The film, whether advertently or inadvertently, comes across as a bad copy of Western popular culture content such as Ghost Rider, Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, Planet of the Apes and Marvel films. At places, the film comes across as a frustrating hodge-podge comprising a standard Bollywood action-thriller, a classic Bollywood romantic film and a substandard Bollywood horror flick. What could have been a breakthrough film for the Bollywood film industry to prove the calibre of Indian filmmakers at the global stage turns out to be yet another run-of-the-mill film that proves to be a nightmare for it's makers. The film's dialogues are quite pallid, predictable and laughable, with the 'simple language' used by the makers including unnecessary slangs such as 'fisaddi', 'dho dunga', 'jalegi' and 'phoonk' in a bid to 'make the film relatable to younger audiences'.What ensues is absolute chaos. The dialogues only go to show the lack of creativity and lazy writing that eclipses even the largely simplistic dialogue writing evident in Brahmastra, which is still miles ahead of this film in terms of being a decent watch that one can return to multiple times. The divine characters in the film do not exude any divinity whatsoever. The film is replete with comical instances of contemporary ideals of fashion being shoved into an ancient era, as is evident from the hairstyles, sarees and tatoo designs present in the film. The chimpanzees in the Vanar sena and the hideous monsters in Ravana's demon army make no sense either. The film had multiple possibilities and could have gone any way. Alas, the makers seemed too intent on self-destructing.While creative liberties are acceptable and previous adaptations of a certain text need not necessarily be adhered to, the film makes a mess of even the basic essence of the Ramayana and the events present in it. Add to it a substandard VFX that couldn't even match that of Brahmastra, a dark, gloomy and depressing colour scheme and cringeworthy action sequences, and the film is the perfect recipie for disaster. It doesn't help either that the character based on Lord Ram comes across as a typical Bollywood romantic hero and angry young man, and the women in the film barely have any say in the goings on, serving merely as embellishments to adorn a male-dominated world. All in all, Adipurush is a massive disappointment.While it does have it's moments and does have certain positives such as the soothing songs, the fantastic background score, the commendable acting of the entire cast as per the script, the opening montage, the closing montage, the battle between Ravana and Raghav and a scene in which the main characters appear together, these are not enough to salvage what turns out be a comedy session on the whole. The supposedly 'encouraging' monologues delivered by Raghav to his army prior to the battle are not motivational from any stretch of the imagination and turn out to be yawn-inducing. The film has very poor production values and third-grade sets that can put Chhota Bheem to shame. By the time the credits roll out, you are bound to feel miserable for those who worked on this film.On the whole, Adipurush is a catastrophe that rightly tanked at the box office. It's hard to belive that this film has been directed by the director of Tanhaji. Neither Om Raut nor Manoj Muntashir can justify this atrocious film. While the film is decent to watch once if you have nothing better to do, it is not advisable to watch this film if you value your life and time. Save your brain cells and find something better to watch.Adipurush- What could have been better:1. The length of the film could have been revised.2. The battle scenes could have been compressed and the time remaining could have been used to focus on the characters who received absolutely no screen time in the film. The battle scenes could also have been more well thought out rather than being made to look like mindless fighting.3. The language could have been a bit more representative of that used in ancient India and by divinity while still being simple. Slangs such as 'jalegi', 'fisaddi', 'dho dunga' and 'phoonk' could have been avoided.4. The VFX team could have taken assistance from trained overseas professionals who have
experiences of working with films with high quality VFX. The colour scheme could have been more varied.5. The costumes, set designs and hairstyles could have been better researched and made more appropriate to ancient India. The tattoos were absolutely unnecessary and could have been avoided.6. The makers could have avoided copying the West. They could also have avoided making the film a confusing Bollywood masala film of sorts. More original ideas could have been sought by the makers with regard to adapting the Ramayana into a film and they could have come up with something unique.7. The women could have been given far more agency in the film. The characters in general could have been more nuanced and complex rather than embodying extreme personalities. The divine characters could have been worked on with greater care.8. Attempts could have been made to maintain the basic essence of the Ramayana and to at least present basic events in a more captivating manner.

I tried watching this movie thinking maybe, just maybe as a fun i would watch it for meme purpose. But the low quality VFX and that senseless flying ghost sequence in the beginning felt like i was playing doom on windows 98 computer. Jaani Dushman has a new found respect in my eyes coz they still did a better job 2 decade back. This movie is a historical blunder but as a cinema lover and film enthusiast who sat through movies like Race 3, Humshakals and Himmatwala, this movie gave me brain annuerism in just 12 minutes into it. OM Raut, you could had done what Vijay Mallya did if you had to just waste 600CR, India would still had forgiven you, but this is beyond repairable.

I usually do not write reviews, but because the current generation does read stories that we read in the early 90s, I don't want the the newer generation to think this is the real Ramayana.This is an insult to Valmiki Ramayana, lot of issues with the story line; screen time was mainly on Ravana instead of Ram, Hanumans power was undermined, Ravana's Lanka was fully made of Gold not some dark matter, Surpanaka's storyline was not inline, Shabari didn't meet Ram directly, instead Ram choose to meet her of all the other ashrams, Ravan's son Indrajith wasn't killed in water at all, and many other flaws in the overall storyline..It felt like the director wanted to create Avengers like movie, but failed miserably, the VXF was a 3rd grade work, felt like I was watching some unfinished video game of 90's era.

Worst adaptation. Worst casting, please don't talk about dialogue. I heard somewhere dialogue writer claimed that it's adaptation or this is the language of present generation, I just want to say this could be language of generation but that was not the language of ramayan. People watch ramayan for calmness and inspiration this language fail to provide that. Writer should understand we don't talk to our father and grandfather like we talk to our friends in the same generation.i don't know what writer and director consume before conceptualizing this.She's aka lakhsman that character was incarnation of sheshnaag he was fierce and capable of lifting world like lotus stem and in this movie he has shown such a lame character without any dialogue.Ram name himself contains calmness but here he is shown as fully grown moustache man who doesn't carry 10 % of his aura.Raavan guy whom ram respect that after killing he bow to him . He should be so knowledgeable and qualified to gain such respect from his enemy. Character of raavan is you can be qualified but if you don't follow dharma your fall in inevitable.Sita Janaki most profound character. Who spent months in raavan' s palace still have faith in his raam you need so much confidence and self esteem on her face but again makers fails to showcase.Overall worst adaptation of ramayan.

They just ruined the main theme of Ramayana with their own storyline & dialogue . They just used Lord Rama's name to make profit. People shouldn't watch it. Their graphics is also worst . Even an amateur graphics designer can do better work than them. Om Raut & Prabhas should left this line after making this disaster. They changed the whole theme as their wish .They used bat to replace pushpak rath which was eating meat. Even awkward dialogue was said by Lord Hanumana in this flim. Ravan's appearance graphics was worst work i have ever seen. They take almost 1+ year to make this disaster. Don't watch it.

Why divert from original ramayana? Director must be sued by all Hindus for hurting the sentiments. Even a normal editor could have made more better graphics than what is there in the movie ... If Hanuman sees the movie then he may hit Om Raut left and right with his Gadhe. Total waste of money if people are watching it as it is distorting the fact of our beautiful Ramayana.

The modernization is okay but keeping simplicity with use new technology could have been made this movie exceptional... the song and some visual effects gives goosebumps but visual effects should have been used to show what Hinduism follows . No need to copy superhero movies from Hollywood and still youth willl love it. You can't mold the simplicity in the story just because you want to scale it to another level.

Since our childhood we are aware of Ramyana... We saw the great Ramanand Sagar created Ramayana on Television & similar other Television serials... We are well aware of what Ramayana means because our generation also heard it's stories from elder's and also read it through various books...
I am greatly impressed by this Om Raut's film because he adopted some new techniques, visual effects to make it more attractive to today's generation without losing it's original theme and message to humanity... I didn't see any objectionable... Director has has taken his liberty to make it to adjust according to new generation... I don't understand why people creating unnecessary controversies about this great Epic?I am sure this film will become milestone for next generation to understand our roots, our culture, our spirituality, our religion...
Thanks to whole Adipurush team for creating such a big & huge film for us !!(Dinesh Patil, Nashik)

Absolutely pathetic and disgrace. This movie does not deserve to be released anywhere in this universe. If they are claiming to be related to Indian history, they should not use any historical names as they have completely altered historical facts. There are holy literatures forming the base of one of the popular and sacred religion 'Hindu' and this movie is totally off the track.I have lost respect to all of the movie characters. PLEASE DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS WATCH THIS MOVIE as this is not even fun mocking some sanctified believes.Please avoid at all cost. Not even the free screen play.Such a shame.

This is bad comedy movie. They tried to make fun of Ramayana and totally failed. Request to director, please don't make this kind of movie. I am not sure how you made Tanhaji movie, that was really good but this time you totally changed my views for you. I will never watch your movies. All the aspects of movie are bad except music.specially dialogues were really bad. I would suggest please see once Ramayana series created Ramanand sagar or read any Hindi translated book on Ramayan, with the at atleast you would be able to right proper sequence of event. Please don't disrespect Ravana. I am not sure how Prabhash said yes for your movie. But please Prabhash don't spoil your image, we had a very good image due to Bahubali.

Worst movie ever produced in history. This movie needs to be taken down from all platforms to prevent Ramayana story.""Adipurush"" is an absolute disaster of a film that fails to capture the essence of the epic it's based on. The direction is haphazard, the acting is wooden, and the CGI is laughably bad. The attempts at grandeur come across as pretentious, and the plot feels like a mere afterthought. It's a painful reminder of how a promising concept can be butchered on the big screen.

This movie has no spirits of Ramayan. The characters and VFX used in movie are worthless as they have ruined wthe whole story of real story of Ram, Sita, Hanuman & Ramayan. The writer of this movie has manipulated with the real story and made a misleading script this is very biased. The writer scripted as the lord Sita was born in India which is nowhere true. As mention in the Ramayan & history, Sita was a daughter of Janak and Janak was the king of Mithila Kingdom which is situated in Nepal and people worship Dita as the daughter of Nepal. You can search the history about Janak, Sita & Janakpur dham in google as well. Thousands of Indian & Hindu visit Janakpur yearly to worship them. To conclude, this movie has degraded the whole Bollywood industry and they should apologize on it. I don't recommend this to anyone.

His voice had better modulation than Prabhas's face.Om Raut has lost his credibility among audience with his direction, never gonna watch another move of his.

Om Raut's retelling of the Ramayana in ""Adipurush"" doesn't live up to its potential. The movie focuses more on action and adventure than on exploring the deeper aspects of human nature that make the epic stories so powerful. The changes made to the story are only surface-level, and the film fails to provide a fresh interpretation.Raut's aim is to attract a younger audience who enjoy video games and superhero movies, but this approach sacrifices emotional depth and intellectual engagement. While the action scenes are exciting, the movie lacks emotional weight. Raut and his co-writer, Manoj Muntashir, take some creative liberties with the story, but they mainly focus on the villains instead of exploring the moral complexities of the characters. This makes the narrative feel rigid and devoid of nuance.It's unfortunate that in modern times, our epic stories are often simplified, leaving no room for the heroes and villains to negotiate or for the audience to ponder the intricacies of human behavior. In ""Adipurush,"" the characters are either portrayed as perfect or completely evil, lacking the complexity that would make them relatable and realistic. The absence of certain characters further contributes to the shallow storytelling.The actors' performances also leave something to be desired. Prabhas, who plays Raghava, lacks the emotional depth needed to portray a character torn between his commitment to virtue and his personal struggles. His delivery of Hindi dialogue lacks the necessary emotion and variation. Other actors, like Sunny Singh and Devdutta Nage, also fail to impress in their respective roles.Saif Ali Khan's portrayal of Lankesh/Raavana is exaggerated and lacks depth, with little insight into the complexity of the character. The attempts to explore Raavana's mind through the conversations among his ten heads come across as amateurish. The combination of live-action and motion capture, while technically impressive, doesn't add much to the storytelling and often looks artificial.The female characters in the movie are poorly developed. Kriti Sanon's Janaki has little impact in the story's male-dominated conflicts, and Sonal Chauhan's Mandodari is given minimal importance after a few lines. Raut's technical skills are evident in capturing the darker aspects of Lankesh, but overall, the movie lacks originality. The depiction of Lanka resembles Gotham City's ruins, and the monsters and primates seem borrowed from other movies. The digitally-created character Sugriv lacks expression, and the romantic scenes between Raghav and Sita feel like generic fashion brand commercials. The music by Ajay Atul shows promise but gets overshadowed by the film's eagerness to focus on the action.In terms of the battle sequences, the visual effects and action lack innovation, relying on outdated techniques that may appear flashy but ultimately fall short. Overall, ""Adipurush"" fails to capture the emotional depth and intensity that could have made it a compelling retelling of the Ramayana.

And by adding such dialogues insulting our gods.I hoped the authenticity could have been maintained. This was not just any other story, but it is one of the most prestigious history of Indians.False knowledge in the movie:1. No character shown is true to their originality. Looks, aura everything is different.2. Hanumanji and ravan looked as if they are not Hindus.3. Ram Lakshman were on vanvas they were supposed to live life like an ordinary Brahmin. Here they have shields and everything.4. They were Kishore, young. Here they look old.5. These are our gods, we are supposed to respect them. The writer has disrespected characters by putting harsh dialogues.Overall I'm extremely hurt. I don't know why no actions were made by censor board.

5:2 Headed Raavan: Fun and CreativeStory Alterations: While adaptations often take creative liberties, the narrative of ""Adipurush"" felt noticeably altered from the expected. This might not sit well with purists or those familiar with the original tale.Editing Issues: A major letdown was the subpar editing, which made the film's flow disjointed.Acting & Dialogues: Unfortunately, the film suffered from lackluster performances and poorly penned dialogues. The characters often came off as insincere, and the dialogues lacked depth and authenticity.Hasty Conclusion: The rushed ending was a disservice to the story's potential, leaving many plot points unresolved or inadequately addressed.Better as Animation?: Might have found a more fitting home in an animated universe, where the boundaries of reality could be more flexibly navigated.In conclusion, Adipurush fell short in crucial areas like storytelling, acting, and technical execution.

The movie is really bad. Such a bad representation of Ramayana, which is our culture and a part of our history. The whole movie was a mess. And also was really disrespectful towards practicing Hindus, for whom Shri Ram, Maa Sita, Hanuman ji are not just characters. Seemed like the movie makers didn't care about the sentiments of people, as well as didn't bother to do even a little bit of research before making the movie. I felt really bad after watching the movie. It is historically inaccurate as well as insanely disrespectful of our deities. The dialogs, costumes, vfx, etc, were the worst. Ramanand Sagar's Ramayana was way better.

They have absolutely made fun of Ram, Sita and Hanuman and our Ramayan. It's absolutely strange to even hear to their interviews where one is saying that they have created Ramayan and others that it is just an inspiration.

Title: Adipurush: A Magnificent Epic That Transcends BoundariesMy rating :10/10Adipurush, the highly anticipated Indian epic fantasy film directed by Om Raut, is a visual extravaganza that brings the ancient tale of the Ramayana to life on the big screen. With its grand scale, breathtaking visuals, and powerful performances, Adipurush succeeds in capturing the essence of the timeless mythological narrative.The film revolves around the legendary characters of Lord Rama and the demon king Ravana, played brilliantly by Prabhas and Saif Ali Khan, respectively. Prabhas delivers a captivating performance as Lord Rama, exuding grace, valor, and righteousness. His portrayal is both stoic and emotive, allowing audiences to connect with his character on a deeper level. Saif Ali Khan, on the other hand, brings a charismatic and menacing presence to the role of Ravana, showcasing his versatility as an actor.One of the standout aspects of Adipurush is its awe-inspiring visual effects. The movie boasts stunning cinematography and meticulous attention to detail in every frame. The larger-than-life sets, breathtaking landscapes, and intricate costumes transport viewers to a mythical world filled with gods, demons, and epic battles. The action sequences are choreographed with finesse, and the use of CGI is seamless, enhancing the overall cinematic experience.Om Raut's direction is commendable, as he skillfully balances the grandeur of the story with intimate character moments. He manages to present the conflict between good and evil with depth and nuance, allowing for a multi-dimensional exploration of the characters' motivations and dilemmas. The screenplay, written by Prakash Kapadia, masterfully adapts the Ramayana into a contemporary narrative that resonates with audiences of all backgrounds.The supporting cast, including Kriti Sanon as Sita and Sunny Singh as Lakshmana, deliver commendable performances, adding depth to the story and complementing the lead actors effectively. Their chemistry and camaraderie contribute to the emotional core of the film.While Adipurush is an enthralling cinematic experience, there are a few minor flaws that prevent it from achieving perfection. At times, the pacing feels slightly uneven, with certain scenes dragging on longer than necessary. Additionally, some character arcs could have been further developed to provide a more well-rounded narrative.Despite these minor shortcomings, Adipurush is an extraordinary achievement in Indian cinema. It is a testament to the immense talent and dedication of the cast and crew involved. The film's powerful storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and stellar performances make it a must-watch for fans of epic fantasies and lovers of mythological tales.Overall, Adipurush transports the audience into a mythical realm, where gods and demons clash in a battle that transcends time. It is a cinematic spectacle that celebrates the age-old tale of good versus evil while leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.

Worst movie I have watched they have ruined the Ramayana by their bad dialogues and poor cgi and VFX . I expected it to be high quality when the movie budget was announced but now after watching the movie I can say that I am so much disappointed. How they have portrayed lord ram, Sita maa , lord Hanuman and ravana. Don't know why people are watching it and the movie and also there are wrong facts shown in the movie . Our government must ban these types of movies which offend religious feelings. The Lanka shown in the movie is similar to Asgard darker version and why Ravan is flying on a bat and he don't even have any gold Armor . Ravan literally had gold Lanka and he was a Brahmin but in movie he was just opposite. Jai Shree Ram.

Adipurus"" is an absolute disaster of a film and undeniably the worst movie of the year. From the opening scene to the closing credits, this cinematic trainwreck is a perfect example of how not to make a movie. The film's lackluster plot, abysmal acting, and nonsensical execution make it an excruciating experience for any unsuspecting viewer.The screenplay is riddled with clichés, plot holes, and contrived twists that leave the audience scratching their heads in confusion. The pacing is uneven, with tedious exposition followed by rushed action sequences that fail to build any tension or emotional investment.The performances in this film are shockingly bad. The cast seems to have been chosen based on their ability to deliver wooden dialogue and display minimal range of emotions. It's as if the actors themselves were aware of the film's lack of quality and couldn't muster any enthusiasm for their roles. Even veteran actors who have delivered commendable performances in the past fall flat in this cinematic disaster.Another major flaw of ""adipurus"" lies in its technical aspects. The cinematography is uninspired, with poorly framed shots and lackluster visual effects that only serve to amplify the film's already glaring issues. The editing is choppy and disjointed, making it difficult to follow the already convoluted storyline.Furthermore, the film's attempt at social message is painfully forced and falls flat. It tries to tackle complex themes such as human thought and the consequences of human arrogance, but its clumsy execution only trivializes these subjects. The dialogue is clunky and overly expository, leaving no room for subtlety or meaningful exploration of the film's underlying themes.To add insult to injury, the film's ending is a complete letdown. After enduring an agonizing hour and a half of mediocrity, the resolution is rushed and unsatisfying. It's as if the filmmakers gave up halfway through and decided to wrap things up hastily, leaving the audience with a profound sense of disappointment.In conclusion, ""notpurush"" is a prime example of wasted potential. With its promising premise and talented cast, it had all the ingredients for a compelling mythological drama. However, due to its poor execution, lackluster performances and a meandering plot, it falls spectacularly flat on its face. Save yourself the agony and steer clear of this cinematic catastrophe.

Ramayana is actually very positive story but here in thjs movie it is shown as a dark movie. If they want to be creative then they can show a similar story but in today's style and characters....dont use ramayana chharacters there.... Who gave them rights to play with people's sentiments like this. We need to stop this so that in future they don't have these guts to make a movie like that which shows our gods using chappri language. This movie must be banned.

This is the worst way of describing such a wonderful scripture. The makers should be extremely ashamed of their work and should be banned from the industry. The director should get a tight slap for mocking the holy scripture. There are many amazing movies that have portrayed a wonderful image for this holy scripture. Legal actions should be taken against these people behind making this movie. Om should be boycotted from the industry and senior actors like Prabhas should also be punished for playing such roles. The whole team is responsible for this disaster. Rating should be -100 or even less.

If you wanted to show only visualization an animation, you could have chosen any other story Such a great book should not have been presented in such a manner. Here the original reference is left aside. This time I feel so strange that I will not like to watch bollywood film in future.

Right from dialouges,costumes ,vfx and everything is so wrong But nothing can beat the casting of prabhas as Ram. Infact casting of every1 character N depiction is so wrong. They have have made nonsense in the name of creative liberty. They have manipulated the facts N have skipped a lot of important Events. Leave goosebumps U will not be able to even connect with characters. Acting of cast is very bad. VFX seems worst than vfx shown in hindi television serials.it looks so bad N fake.Overall According to me it's so bad it doesn't even deserve a 1 star but i cant give it 1/2 so here it is 1 star.

Blatant mockery of our sacred script. This movie lacked all the innocence and purity. Zero acting , zero dialogue delivery.Total commercialisation with no threads of spirituality.Prabha's talent has not been used wisely in the film. The stature of Lord Ram, his persona is not well depicted in the film. All the emphasis is on Ravan. Saif played well
But he could have looked if he had to play khilji. He doesn't seemed liked a Ravan for instance. Pathetic dialogue delivery.Sentiments of many have been hurt.This film should not have been released.Better was expected out of Om Raut.Pls don't watch. It a mockery.

We've liked the movie. Specially animation in 3D.I'm not sure why the movie has got so less ratings, however it deserves more stars. Direction, songs, animations, fighting, sound everything looks good. Yes it doesn't get 10 fine but it doesn't reserve 3 or 4 rating.Makeup of Rama could have been better.There may be mistakes, but this is a movie one can't expect as it is with real.When I saw on theater, was really surprised to see the movie and couldn't coincide with the public review and media outcomes.Overall it doesn't deserve 4 rating, its between 7 to 9 based person's opinion.Please go and watch on theater and specially 3D.

Where do I even begin with the abysmal disaster that is Adipurush? This movie epitomizes everything that can go wrong in the film industry. From the horrendous acting to the lackluster storyline, it is a complete letdown on every front.Let's start with the cast. Prabhas, who is known for his charisma and talent, fails to deliver even a remotely convincing performance. His expressions are wooden, and his dialogue delivery is monotonous throughout the entire film. It feels like he sleepwalked through his role, showing zero effort to bring any depth or emotion to his character.Saif Ali Khan as the antagonist was equally disappointing. His portrayal of Ravana, a legendary and complex character, was nothing short of laughable. Instead of capturing the essence of the character, Khan came across as comical and completely miscast. It's hard to take him seriously as a formidable foe for Prabhas' character.The screenplay and dialogue writing in Adipurush are shockingly poor. The dialogues lack impact and fail to create any memorable moments. The narrative is disjointed, with scenes that seem randomly stitched together. The pacing is incredibly sluggish, making the already tedious storyline feel even more agonizing.The visual effects, touted as one of the film's highlights, are a massive disappointment. The CGI is poorly executed and lacks finesse, leaving the mythical elements of the story looking cheap and unconvincing. It's evident that the filmmakers cut corners and failed to invest in high-quality effects, resulting in a subpar visual experience.Moreover, the music and background score are forgettable, failing to elevate any of the film's scenes. The songs feel forced and unnecessary, serving as mere distractions from the lackluster plotline.Adipurush's biggest flaw is its disrespect towards the source material. It takes a beloved mythological tale and reduces it to a mindless and shallow spectacle. The film lacks depth, fails to explore the characters' motivations, and completely disregards the cultural and historical significance of the story it attempts to portray.In conclusion, Adipurush is a colossal disappointment and a waste of time and resources. The poor acting, weak screenplay, shoddy visual effects, and overall lack of creativity make it an unbearable cinematic experience. I would strongly advise against subjecting yourself to this cinematic disaster.

What they were thinking while making this movie. In India every hindu knows what is ramayana and what is the story. I think the director was sleeping like kumbkaran when ramanand Sagar ramayana was shown on TV. Even during covid it was shown. I think director was over smart guy, he must have thought that he will make something different, he didn't want to copy somebody work. I want to tell you director Saab, you have to copy because there is only one ramayana, not 2-3 versions. What you have made is copy of planet of apes and lord of rings. Public will never forgive you for this. You have destroyed a beautiful story.worst movie ever made.

ADIPURUSH is based on the epic, Ramayana. Om Raut's adapted story is a classic. Clearly Om Raut, as a new generation film maker, and back with the accolades of his 2020 super hit film TANHAJI: THE UNSUNG WARRIOR, is driven to tell his eternal tale to a younger audience, that has grown up to VFX films and Super hero franchises from the likes of Marvel etc. To celebrate our own stories is not just laudable but indeed commendable for any storyteller. Some of the scenes are well thought out and interpreted. He also keeps the narrative simplified. However, one feels that Manoj Muntashir Shukla's dialogues could have been more impactful. The only dialogue that stands out is Raghav's speech before the climax battle.

First of all the starting of movie is so bad that the barely say any words only has some background music tones. The clothes that Janaki wears in this movie is too modern which was not meant to be like that and the movie states that JANAKI was born in india which is totally wrong JANAKI WAS BORN IN NEPAL not in india. They have totally messed up the story of Ramayan and the area of Ravan was decorated with gold but in movie it is shown that Ravan lives in some dark places and also havent shown the proper path that leads to Lanka.VFX in this movie is the worst.

It looks he has drunk very hard. Hanuman character should be trimmed from the movie then it will add more value to movie. Said ali khan character should be renamed as ashique awara and prabhas character raju halwai. I suggest you rename all charactets and rename lanka also in this movie. Worst movie. Vfx is better than any pakistan movie vfx but worat than the vfx used in daily serial. Not even one good thing to say about this movie.

Warning - You will get very angry after watching this movie.Don't know where to really start from, this is an epic disappointment on all levels. And the fears really came true, the VFX is so poor that, you start to wonder if this is a beta version of a video game launched several years ago, it is that cartoonish and was an eyesore. Acting wise, none really standout, though the aggressive version of Lord Rama played into the strengths of Prabhas, he was just okayish, Kriti had just to smile and weep. Even with a caricaturish characterisation of Ravan, it was Saif who had put some genuine effort among all the cast and crew. Screenplay is so lazy, the dialogues at places are as cringeworthy as hell. Technically, for a 500Cr project, this has to be the biggest scam in Indian Cinema in the recent times, nothing much about cinematography, as the entire movie was shot indoor, editing is pathetic, action choreography was straight out of many Hollywood movies. Only saving grace is the songs of Ajay-Atul and the score of Sachet-Parampara, it really elevates the proceedings.

The visual effects are often subpar, with some scenes looking unfinished or even amateurish.The dialogue is often cringe-worthy, with some lines feeling like they were written by a teenager.The film's superhero movie parallels are jarring and out of place, and they often detract from the film's overall impact.The film's portrayal of certain characters has been met with disapproval from some viewers, including Lord Rama's depiction as an Angry Young man.One of the worst movies ever made. It is a nonsensical, poorly-acted, and unintentionally hilarious film that is sure to leave you scratching your head. The plot is non-existent, the characters are one-dimensional, and the dialogue is cringeworthy. However, the film's flaws are also its greatest strengths. The Room is so bad that it is actually good. It is a cult classic that has been praised by critics and audiences alike.If you are looking for a good laugh, then I highly recommend. It is a truly unique and unforgettable film that you will never forget.

Just spoiled the whole story with worst dialogues and worst screenplay. Even the writter has has changed the story. The film was made based on the Hindu Mythological epic The Ramayana. The film changed the character names. The director and story writter also ruined the screenplay and visuals. I have seen the original Ramayana more than 10 times. But the old one is gold. In the movie the characters does not fit perfect to the original Ramayana. The dialogues of Lord Hanuman are just miscreated. Looks of Ravan or Dashanan or Lankesh is offensive in my point of view. Sita often looks like a widow with white saree which is unacceptable.

Does Bollywood have any good story: No, the film looks like a cartoon show. Ravan was a very powerful Sali king. Shani Dev was imprisoned by Ravan, he had so much power. Ravan used to have a gold necklace, there is a dark hole shown here, which means that what has fallen is shown upside down.

","
As a fan of epic fantasy films, I had high hopes for ""Adipurush,"" but it turned out to be an absolute trainwreck from start to finish. This movie is a prime example of how even a star-studded cast and a big budget cannot save a poorly executed film.First and foremost, the storytelling in ""Adipurush"" is utterly confusing and incoherent. The plot jumps around haphazardly, leaving the audience bewildered and struggling to connect the dots. There is a severe lack of character development, and the motivations of the main characters remain unclear throughout the entire film. It feels as if the writers themselves were unsure of what they were trying to convey, resulting in a convoluted mess.While the movie boasts of impressive visual effects, they are merely a smokescreen to distract from the lack of substance. The CGI is overused to the point of absurdity, and it often feels like you're watching an animated film rather than a live-action epic. The action sequences, which should have been the film's saving grace, are poorly choreographed and lack any real excitement or intensity. It's a disappointment to see such potential wasted on lackluster execution.The performances in ""Adipurush"" are equally disappointing. The usually charismatic and talented cast members are given little to work with, and their performances come across as wooden and uninspired. Even the great actors struggle to salvage the poorly written dialogue, leaving the audience cringing at the forced and unnatural exchanges.Moreover, the film suffers from severe pacing issues. It drags on for an excruciatingly long time, with unnecessary subplots and filler scenes that add nothing to the overall story. The excessive runtime only adds to the frustration and makes the experience more unbearable.Finally, the film's attempts to tackle complex themes and messages fall flat. The half-hearted social commentary feels forced and poorly integrated into the narrative, making it seem like an afterthought rather than a genuine attempt at depth.In conclusion, ""Adipurush"" is an absolute disaster of a film. It fails on every level, from storytelling and character development to visual effects and performances. It's a waste of both time and money. I would strongly advise against subjecting yourself to this cinematic catastrophe.

Adipurush, directed by Om Raut, is an epic retelling of the revered Hindu mythological tale, the Ramayan. With its perfect casting, melodic music, incredible graphics, and breathtaking war sequences, the film successfully captivated me. Adipurush showcases the journey of Lord Ram, portrayed impeccably by Prabhas, and highlights his heroic exploits in the battle against the formidable Ravan.One of the film's standout aspects is the perfect casting of Prabhas as Lord Ram. His demeanour exudes the noble qualities and righteousness that the character demands. Prabhas's screen presence and dedication to his role elevate the heroism of Sri Ram, making his character truly engaging and inspiring.The melodic music of Adipurush adds depth and emotion to the storytelling. The film's soundtrack beautifully complements the narrative, enhancing the audience's connection with the characters and their journey. The songs and background score resonate well with the mythological theme, providing a rich and immersive experience.Indian makers have left no stone unturned in creating incredible graphics and visually stunning war sequences. The grandeur and attention to detail in these scenes are truly commendable. The battles are choreographed and executed with precision, making them a spectacle to behold. The Indian film industry showcases its technical prowess through the impressive visual effects, which enhance the mythological elements of the story.Adipurush does justice to the important episodes of the Ramayan, whether it's the encounter with Jatayuvu, the meeting with Shabari, or the iconic scene of Hanuman burning Lanka. Each episode is beautifully shot, capturing the essence and significance of these moments. The attention to detail and the portrayal of these episodes add depth and meaning to the overall narrative.The film presents a strong portrayal of Ravan, who serves as the antagonist to Sri Ram's heroism. The character of Ravan is depicted with depth and complexity, showcasing his power and intelligence. This adds to the overall conflict and raises the stakes for Lord Ram, creating a compelling dynamic between the two characters.However, one of the drawbacks of Adipurush is that most of the sequences are shot in dark settings. While this might add to the intensity and mood of certain scenes, it results in a lack of colorful skies, vibrant flowers, and visually appealing clothing. This absence of vivid colors can make the film feel somewhat monotonous visually, especially considering the grandeur and beauty associated with the Ramayan. Most negative reviews are nit picking, ignoring the larger picture.In conclusion, Adipurush is a visually stunning and emotionally captivating retelling of the Ramayan. Prabhas delivers a remarkable performance as Lord Ram, and the film's music, graphics, and war sequences leave a lasting impact. While the dark settings might be a drawback for some viewers, the overall experience of the film is engrossing, and it successfully brings to life the epic tale of good versus evil. I am no big devotee of Sri Ram but this elevated my reverence for him. I am proud that an Indian has made such an epic film. Adipurush is a must-watch for fans of mythology and epic storytelling.

This movie is the biggest example of how not to make a movie.There are 100s of things that gone wrong-
Horribly childish VFX, wrong facts, internationally alteration of main characters to avoid legal trouble, heartless acting.The writer and director probably thought, the movie will anyway become hit because they are making a movie based on epic Ramayana.In one interview Manoj Muntashir said the movie is made to entertain and give knowledge about Ramayana to young generation and after a few days he said in a different interview - ""this movie is inspired by Ramayana but this is not Ramayana"".A person a bad mentality should not even touch our religion epics.

Adipurush is an experimental movie to portray Ramayana with some real Vanaras and Rakhasas .Cons:
I do accept the way the "" Vanara Sena "" of Lord Rama and "" Rakshasa Sena "" of Ravana and Ravana himself were shown differently and appearances were too alien to our culture.. but once you dwell into the story they just seem to be doing their part.Pros:
I would give a thumps up to BGM, songs.Screenplay was good ..there were no out of place scenes.Lord Raghav - Prabhas !!!! His performance was at peeks at moments -- when he meets Hanuma for the first time, when he sees Janaki for the first time after she was kidnapped, when lakshmana was attacked by Indrajit...
Janaki - Kriti acted really good as Sita
Ravana - Saif played his part good ... But I really felt there was some inconvenience while walking and his voice rendered like Alien..so .. I could not connect that much
Hanuman was both funny and devotional...and other s Lakshmana, Indrajeeth, Vibhishaba..all others good to their scripts..Finally my experience is that you can definitely watch this movie once ...and children will surely enjoy the 3D effects. 3D effects were far better than Avatar(recent release)

""Adipurush"" proves to be a disappointing rendition of the classic Ramayana tale, attempting to modernize it in a way that comes across as cheap and poorly executed. The decision to take the story to a street-level setting only serves to strip away the grandeur and depth of the original narrative, leaving behind a hollow and disconnected adaptation.With its emotional core missing, ""Adipurush"" disappoints viewers who anticipated a more heartfelt reimagining. While modernization has potential, the film's failure to capture the essence of the Ramayana leaves it wanting.In sum, ""Adipurush"" stands as a cautionary example of attempting to modernize a beloved classic without preserving its emotional depth. The film's impersonal approach and disconnection from the original narrative rob it of the intended sentiment, resulting in a lackluster cinematic experience.

Ramayan is Aadikavya. It teaches us the life lessons through maryada purushottam, Sri Rama.Om Raut, Prabhas and team has tried their best to bring Yuddhakanda of Ramayan to the curren generation with high technical values. Please do not compare this movie with Ramanand Sagar Ramayan or NTR as Rama. A section of people intentionally trolling with negetive propaganda.Trollers got few dialogues out of context and few shots. No one can be perfect in this world. We see movies with full of violence, nudity, vulgar content and still make them hit. We support movies where Terrorists are shown as hero's, still accept. But we can not accept our epic Ramayan with minor mistakes?Don't carry away by the negative reviews. I rate this movie 10/10.Ramayana is for all. Every one must watch this movie.

Prabhas anna fantastic acting 💥💥
Prabhas anna ki jai!!!! Loved his amazing performance as Raghava and his chemistry with Kriti as our very own Janaki was beautiful! Best comeback from Prabhas anna! Jai Shree Ram!!!Kriti Sanon as Janaki, she looked so beautiful and stunningly gorgeous!! Singer Lipsika garu is the perfect dubbing voice for Kriti in Telugu! Hope to see Kriti in more Telugu movies.Saif Ali Khan sir as Lankesh was pretty menacing, deadly and ruthless! His performance as a villain was totally outstanding! Ravana deserves to be hated as what he did with Sita Maiya was wrong and Ramji had the right to kill him and destroy Lanka! P. Ravi Shankar garu is the perfect dubbing voice for Saif sir in Kannada and Telugu as he has such a strong voice and he uplifts the villain's character.Sunny Singh as Sheshu, did a pretty decent job and acted well in the film. Acting with Prabhas anna is truly an honour for an actor!Devdatta Nageji as Bajrang, was fantastic!!!! The cheers he brought in the theatre and electrified the audience! Jai Bajrang Bali ki Jai!!!!Supporting cast did well in their roles!Music is absolutely fantastic and I love the songs honestly! Best soundtrack! Ajay-Atulji and Sachet-Parampara did a great job with composing the songs. Lyricists Ramjo garu and Manoj Muntashirji wrote the songs beautifully. Jai Shri Ram totally uplifts the film!!! Ram Siya Ram is such a beautiful and emotionally soul lifting song!Background music by the Balsara brothers gives inducing goosebumps!!!! VFX and CGI look way better in 3D after many changes and rectifications.

I watched Adipurush yesterday and I loved it. It was a great movie with amazing visuals and action scenes. The story was engaging and the actors did a fantastic job. It was awesome to see how they brought the epic to life on the big screen. Adipurush is a must-watch for everyone
Adipurush was a spectacular movie that I watched yesterday. I was mesmerized by the stunning visuals and the thrilling action sequences. The plot was captivating and the performances were superb.

Superb movie. From past 20 years no one dare to bring Ramayan on big screen.we should appreciate the adhipursh team for bringing ramayayan for younger generations. They made every one to say Jai Sree ram from almost one month.this the biggest achievement for adhipursh team. Jai sri ram. I personally liked the movie very much. Prabhas is the biggest super star of India. Raghava and janaki are looking good.kid will enjoy the movie.so make sure everyone to watch it.if you watch in 3d it will be good. Indian movie standards are improving if u encourage them they will bring our historical movies on big screen.

SECOND half is bit lag. Over all good watch looking to watch this movie again In this week. VFX is good in this budget looks like some gang expecting Marvel and DC range output. BGM and Songs are top notch. I really loved shivoham song. The lyrics and action during the song is superb, jatayu scene is great,. Ram meeting hanuman gave be gusebumps. Totally worth watch.

Take a bit of Avengers and Lord of The Rings, add a pinch of Game of Thrones, and top it up with Temple Run - Adipurush is served. Yes, it's no easy feat to recreate an epic tale, but with all the research and material handy, if this is director Om Raut's best take on the contemporary Ramayana, we need to go back and revisit the original in all its glory, and restore our sanity. Adipurush is merely a Bollywood-ised version of one of the most epic tales that ever existed. How creators can't able sense the sentiment toward own God and made then say words that's doest even we expect to say. Don't make it when you are not capable of making it gracefully.

Hero Prabhas took it very well and made the movie blockbuster with his acting. And coming to the movie there was very little scenes where we feel the story of Ramayana was not matching, but Ramayana is told different in different places, so the story may vary from place to place but the director tried to direct the film according to the maximum of audience heard stories. If you are having a doubt about vfx and graphics, it was good and nice to experience the 3D. The BGM nothing but backgroundscore was awesome and the scenes containing Hanuman will literally gives you goosebumps. The Hanuman character was done by Devadatta Nage, and his acting was phenomenal and also he was the biggest part of the movie in making it successful. The minus points were the director failed to show the Lanka. Actually Lanka was the most beautiful place on Earth but in movie you doesn't feel like that, Apart from that no complains but I felt it would be more better if there was some better vfx and graphics. So overall the movie was good and you can watch with your families in your nearby theatres. I hope this review was helpful and please watch the movie only in theatres.Due to negative review I kept my expectations low, I took my family including my nephews.

613,23 June 2023," A Disappointing Adaptation: Adipurush Falls Short of Expectations
","
Adipurush, a highly anticipated movie based on the epic Ramayan, falls disappointingly short of expectations. From poor costume design and questionable creative choices to inconsistent storytelling and a lack of depth in understanding the source material, the film fails to capture the essence and grandeur of the original narrative. The subpar dialogue writing further hampers the film's impact, while inaccurate portrayals of key characters and settings contribute to a lack of authenticity. Adipurush ultimately fails to deliver a satisfying cinematic experience, leaving viewers longing for a more respectful and engaging adaptation of the beloved epic.

And lastly Ravan DehenIt has its moments but the kind of things and negativity portrayed this movie dont deserve that atleast Who Tried portraying Ramayana and keeping everyones faith ...Trust me you will not regret it but there is clearly an agenda around this film ... every director has his own way of expressing & Prabhu shri Ram has been shown as warrior which he is ....Jai shree Ram.

Watched in 3D movie is nice, vfx also ok, already director mentioned that he is using own vision in creating style for characters, and also not criticised story line anywhere, Hollywood movies we don't know origin, so we see what they show, and feels super, excellent. Why we should fix our mind that characters in ramayana should be like that only. Vfx also nice, we should feel proud of first movie in motion capture.Raavan look is highlight, background music super, and all the songs screened super, Lanka might be bright to show, first intro fight not that much good to see, 3D effects are super.

Very few actors in the current generation can pull off mythological or periodic roles with ease and conviction, and Prabhas is one among them. The actor has an unmatched aura and royalty, and Adipurush couldn't have been any better if some other actor had played Lord Sri Rama. The PAN-India star amazes big time with his charisma, body language, and dialogue delivery, and he fits the bill perfectly as Lord Rama. The way he utters lengthy dialogues and his screen presence are indomitable.One more best thing to have happened to Adipurush is Saif Ali Khan. The team had an uphill task of casting an actor who could match Prabhas, and they indeed did a great job by casting Saif Ali Khan. The star actor makes the film even fiery with his incredible performance as Lankesh, i.e., Ravanasura. Saif Ali Khan performs it to the tee and has scored brownie points too.Sita character is definitely a challenge for someone like Kriti Sanon, who mostly played glamorous roles in her career, but boy, she is perfect as Janaki, aka Sita. Kriti's divine looks and her mature performance adds depth to the proceedings. Devdatte Nage, the Marathi actor, breathed life into the role of Lord Hanuman. Sunny Singh, Vatsal Sheth, and Sonal Chauhan pass muster.Om Raut's strength lies in showcasing the drama, and he handled the first half in a very neat manner. There are many well-executed sequences in the first hour, including the Jatayu - Ravana fight, Hanuman meeting Rama for the first time, the face-off between Sugriva and Vaali, and Hanuman setting Lanka on fire. These aspects are something that are very familiar to the audience, but the way Om Raut has presented them intrigues one. Ajay-Atul duo's songs are superb, to say the least, and the background score has lifted the movie in many areas.

One of the worst movie with huge budget in bollywood. The director deserves the worst movie award.poor storyboard, poor casting (except Kriti all the other characters are not upto the mark not e en 50%), poor vfx and cgi created characters. Copied actions and dialogues from other movies and memes. The most worse is its dialogue by Manoj. The low budget CGI characters were borrowed from Harry Potter, Rise of the planet of apes, GOT, etc. The Ravana in this movie is very creative like Ironman's Tony Stark. Overall it's a flop movie. I request imdb to allow us to provide negative stars. Cause ot deserves minus infinity.

Adhipurush movie is superb and every character in this movie is touching our hearts and their suited there role in this movie and vfx also improved after the teaser I can give 10 stars
livers an extraordinary performance as Lord Ram. His portrayal effortlessly captures the essence of the character, showcasing both his strength as a warrior and his unwavering devotion as a prince. Prabhas's dedication to the role is evident in every scene, making him a perfect fit for the epic tale.Saif Ali Khan's portrayal of the formidable antagonist, Ravana, is an absolute treat to watch. He brings an unmatched intensity to the role, infusing Ravana with a complex mix of power, arrogance, and vulnerability. Saif's nuanced performance elevates the character, making him more than just a typical villain. The confrontations between Prabhas and Saif are electrifying and undoubtedly some of the highlights of the film.Director Om Raut's vision and storytelling prowess shine through in every frame of Adipurush. The grandeur and scale of the production are breathtaking, and the attention to detail in recreating ancient settings is commendable. The visual effects are top-notch, seamlessly blending with the narrative and adding an extra layer of realism to the mythical world. The battle sequences are awe-inspiring, leaving you at the edge of your seat, completely absorbed in the epic clash between good and evil.The supporting cast also deserves praise for their outstanding performances. Kriti Sanon as Sita brings grace and strength to the character, while Sunny Singh as Laxman displays unwavering loyalty and a fiery spirit. They add depth to the narrative, complementing the central characters perfectly.The music and background score by Ajay-Atul are mesmerizing, capturing the essence of the story and enhancing the emotional impact of key moments. The songs are beautifully choreographed, adding to the overall visual splendor of the film.Adipurush is more than just a retelling of a mythological tale; it's a celebration of our rich cultural heritage. It explores timeless themes of love, sacrifice, and the triumph of good over evil. The film not only entertains but also sparks a sense of pride and reverence for our mythology.In conclusion, Adipurush is an extraordinary cinematic experience that deserves all the accolades it receives. Prabhas's stellar performance, Saif Ali Khan's compelling portrayal, and Om Raut's masterful direction come together to create an epic spectacle that will leave you in awe. This movie sets a new benchmark for Indian cinema and is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates grand storytelling and visual splendor.

First half excellent second half is full of actions though last 2-3 mins after the ravaan has been killed it was not to acceptable with poor graphics. This should not be considered as it is as Ramanand Sagar's Ramayan. You will find a modern touch in it which kids will enjoy. In the beginning of the movie disclaimer has been given that this is not exactly taken from Ramayan by Ramanand Sagar this is just inspired with a modern story line and graphics, though some of the dialogues should have been put in a better way, but it's ok with a new modern thought for new era of people. Overall a great movie to watch.

The main plus point is acting of devdattnage as hanuman this man done a fabulous job. The scenes blw raghav and bajarang are looking good as well as they are to emotional

Contrast wonder here and there continuously. Don't believe on contrast mind like Rawana. Believe on truth Lord Rama. Rama fight against Rawana for truth only. And Rama won the fight and meet Sita. Sita itself is truth. Hanuma is true spiritual devotee of Rama. Hw always worship Rama.

Adipurush, if one remembers, was supposed to be an modern adaptation of Ramayan and hence the makers chose to have a free run with the creative liberties in this film and it all went wrong .Adipurush itself starts from the middle of Ramayana where lord Ram was sent to the jungles for 14 years exile . Hence the film doesn't have any build up to any character.First, the characters itself have no introduction whatsoever. Makers assume since we know Ramayana, so no need to introduce anyone properly. Lord Ram is just introduced through some pictures in the opening credit while laxman and Sita ma have even further lower introduction. Honestly saying if one didn't tell you that Sunny Singh is laxman, you probably won't know. Jatayu pops up randomly and gets to poorest adieu . It's almost as if Lord Ram doesn't even know who Jatayu is. Bali , the brother of Sugreev, has absolutely no introduction.Next, the setting. If it's a modern adaptation of Ramayana, then why is the Lord Ram side shown to be taken straight from Ramayana but Lanka and it's people especially Raavan are shown as people of some Azguard (Thor) ? Clearly there is inconsistency . If you remember the original Ramayana, both Ram and Raavan side had almost similar kind of dresses with kings wearing king like dresses etc. Here, both sides wear dresses belonging to opposite poles.Next, the execution. It's horrendous. Bali and Sugreev's fight is the worst looking one which gets over in no time without any introduction to Bali. As they fight, you can't even understand who is Bali and who is Sugreev. The part where Sita gets kidnapped by the Sadhu is not accurate. The Sadhu i believe never gave evil smiles . Jatayu's adieu is just ignored. In the earlier Ramayana, Jatayu has a heartfelt conversation with lord Ram in his arms before dying but here, Jatayu is just treated like a random bird. Last but not the least, everything on the lankan side is so poorly executed. Lord Hanuman burns Lanka with his tail but it barely burns, just random explosions here and there that's it.Next, I want to talk about Indrajith and Vibhishan. My god what kind of portrayal is this? Indrajit looks like a party animal from some Noida club and he possesses powers of Flash !! The level of creative liberties they took!! Vibhishan is so hard to believe he's vibhishan as he doesn't act like him only . They all got weird tattoos on their body especially indrajith . Itna bhi modern nahi karna tha !!VFX and dialogues. Let's not talk about it you already know how it is. The final war sequence also looks so cartoonish that it sucks the essence out of it.Let's talk about Raavan played by Saif. He does try very hard to make Raavan look menacing. His character is even given a terrifying bgm . However, the rest things of his looks so weird. His 10 heads rendered VFX looks hilarious at best. His hairstyle is again Noida Gurugram style. He feeds non veg to his dragon vehicle (why is non veg shown in this film at first place?). All these creative choices just don't fit Raavan. The makers have just played around with the Lanka side while fearfully avoiding any creative changes on Ram side .Songs are good as well as the BGM. That's the only reason I gave this film 2 stars.Prabhas as lord Ram should never have been there. He's just angry faced , barely smiles and has no expressions at all. His body is an entire VFX render throughout.Overall, i thought KBKJ was the worst film this year but Adipurush beats it by a mile solely because it has ruined an epic saga so close to all Hindus. Adipurush just shows a part of the entire Ramayana that too with little to no detailing with its running time being 3 hrs and back in 1992, the Yugo Sako version showed all details and the entire tale of Ram in under 2hrs 50 mins. It clearly shows the quality difference of the makers .

Adipurush picture is excellent and worth watching. This type of movie is not prepared before. Full of actions, animation, and it is an excellent presentation. Though the picture is based on Ramayan but its objectives are to show the actions of the story in an animated and different way. This type of presentation never seen before in Indian Cinema. Prabhas is excellent as Raghunandan. Saif Ali Khan as Ravann also done his part very well. Kriti Sanon is also very good as Janki. The film has very less diaglogues and more of animation and action. Please dont watch with previous mindset of Ramayan seen in Drama, Picture or Serials. Every Ramayan presentation has got its own values Ram and all others Charactor but this is an action and animated film. Everytime you will looking at something new and exciting. Hats off to the director Om Raut.

Not sure why this movie had upset a lot of film fans , it nothing less than a marvel superhero films , I believe makers had wrongly portrayed & marketed adipurush in traditional Ramayana. It's a fight of ram for his beloved wife who was adbucted by Ravan . Am sure if om had taken film and designed characters as we know it , it would have not even reached 50cr collection.It's a visual epic, all my family enjoyed film and appreciate the effort Om and his team put in. There are some issues with film like the fight could have been 15 min shorter and huppa huya sing would have been added. Instead of designing ravana army like comic characters they could have been in human formats with rakshak attire .. & ravana is demon he can have many forms and many hair styles there is nothing wrong in it ..no body is sure how ravana used to look .. when will smith made Jesus character or when askhay made Krishna's character did we comment on their outlook .. it's a film made for future kids and portrayed characters as superheroes.. I don't think anyone would have made adipurush better than what it is .. however only lack is at the time of promotions team could have taken care with kid format marketing and portraying vanarsaina etc.

In my personal view the movies sticks to the core values of Valmiki Ramayana. My experience in 3D was fantastic. I have never seen such high quality VFX in Indian cinema. The scenes whenever Bajrang character appears were excellent. The movie really has many amazing moments. Certain scenes were modernized in order to appeal to the new age audience and they were really were good. Saif Ali Khan did an awesome job as Lankesh. Prabhas and Kirti suited perfectly as Raghav and Janaki. It is a must watch film in theatres. I have given ten in order support the film audience who watch films with an open mind instead of spreading hatred.

Adipurush movie was a fantastic experience for me and I don't agree with the low ratings it has received. It is a stunning rendition of Ramayana with superb performances by Prabhas and Saif Ali Khan. Prabhas embodied Raghava, the noble hero who stands for truth and love. Saif Ali Khan impressed me as Lankesh, the ruthless and clever villain who tests Raghava's resolve and endurance. The action scenes were exhilarating and the music was memorable. The movie also highlighted the significance of values like fidelity, bravery and dedication. I think it is one of the finest movies based on Ramayana and I would suggest it to anyone who enjoys mythology and adventure.

ADIPURUSH is based on the epic, Ramayana. Om Raut's adapted story is a classic. Clearly Om Raut, as a new generation film maker, and back with the accolades of his 2020 super hit film TANHAJI: THE UNSUNG WARRIOR, is driven to tell his eternal tale to a younger audience, that has grown up to VFX films and Super hero franchises from the likes of Marvel etc. To celebrate our own stories is not just laudable but indeed commendable for any storyteller. Some of the scenes are well thought out and interpreted. He also keeps the narrative simplified. However, one feels that Manoj Muntashir Shukla's dialogues could have been more impactful. The only dialogue that stands out is Raghav's speech before the climax battle.

The whole movie is a mockery of Ramayana, had to watch Ramayana The legend of prince Rama after coming home from theatre.Only good thing was the song in the beginning.They distorted each and every scene, and added there own imagination.Ravan taking back Janaki on a bat, like really?Hanuman ji's Sanjeevani scene not given any importance and the ahit dialogues.Vibhishan's wife preparing medicine to save Lakshman, dude you could easily show the story of the Vaidya ji instead, had enough time.None of the war scenes were organic, it felt lifeless.Damn why hanuman ji shown as he is and you made apes out of Sugriv and Vali, they were all same dammit.They did not do justice to any of the war scenes.Out of all that Brahma ji gave wrong Vardan to Ravan, it was Hiranyakashyap's vardan.Nobody told Ram to ut the arrow in Ravanas navel, he just knew it according to them.They could do so much in those 3 hours, wasted it completely.

Understand that creators had to put the opinion of connecting with the audience and so they have used the language which as per them is more understanding to us. I appreciate the work done on the movie.Ramayana consist of 24000 verses written by Valmiki Ji, bringing that long script into a runtime of 3 hrs is an achievement in itself.Background music is damm good.The art by actors of the movie is quite visible on screen, they have put their best efforts.Prabhas in the lead role as Lord Rama. The film has garnered significant attention and anticipation due to its scale and star cast. It aims to bring the epic tale of Ramayana to the big screen in a visually stunning manner.

634,21 June 2023," Watch it before making up your mind
","
I heard all the complaints from people, but decided to watch it before making up my mind about it. After watching it I can say with assurance that people are overhyping the issues with this movie. A 5 second dialogue does not represent the vision of the makers. This is not a remake of Ramanand Sagar's Ramayana. This a vision of the director. A character's appearance does not change their historically accurate attributes. There are definite issues with movie, but making an assertion without giving it a chance is unfair. Moreover, the movie is made for close to $70 million. Movies like Ant Man Quantumania and Black Adam are made for almost triple the budget. The VFX is great considering the amount of VFX and the relatively low budget.Cons:
1. There was no need to CGI Sri Ram. Prabhas's normal built was acceptable.2. They could have hired an actor who is already buffed to play Hanuman Ji. There was no need to CGI. A lot of VFX budget could have been saved on the above two points.3. The introduction of Sri Ram did not need to have so much CGI. That scene felt like the CGI artists showing off what they can do. Instead, that budget could have been utilized in improving the movements of Jamvant and the Bali-Sugriv fight.4. Someone better could have played Lakshman Ji. The actor could not do justice to the nature of Lakshman ji.Pros:
1. I expected Saif to be the worst part of the movie, but turns out he was the best. He played the character really well.2. The who played Hanuman Ji was great.3. The visuals were mostly great.Overall, I welcome negative reviews for the movie, but I urge people to watch the movie legitimately before making up their mind, weather its in a theatre or on an OTT platform.

The movie is perfect to attract new generation kids who has never seen or heard our ancient scriptures. Visual graphics are perfect to attract younger children and engage them in the storytelling. Also it is impossible to include all chapters of Ramayana in three hours. The boycott is unwelcoming for a great effort by director. Except 1-2 dialogues nothing found offensive. The epic drama in a linear way would not be enough to attract audience. The character look for Ravan is well in line with known information like tall height, devotee of shiva are well portrayed. It is worth to take the kids for this epic drama.

I was skeptical at first because of all the negative reviews going on in media. But trust me loved the movie and concept. Of course that message of win of good over evil is embedded in the movie and it is shown in beautiful way. Loved the the way saif Ali khan portrayed the role of Ravana showcasing ego and power which Ravana had. Few dialogues here and there could have been changed but that should not make any difference. Prabhas has lived up to the Character and played the role beautifully. Kriti Sanon was graceful and so was sunny singh. Special shoutout to vfx team and devdutt for playing lord hanuman in a beautiful way.

The review is not from a "" ONE DAY BAKTH ""Watch the film if you have your own opinion and mind and not sensitive enough to get brainwashed by the pages and negative tweetsThe message was clear the :"" good over evil"" the good is more good and the evil was shown more evil and people who have issues with ravans character they don't know anything about valmiki ramyan yes he is bramhin shiv bakth and all but he was also evil rakshas and he kidnapped a vanavasis wife no matter how good is he is if you do bad to a women your bad it's clearly projected
The film was good yes the film was good.The people who was trolling The film and pages brutally I'm sure 80cent of them did not even watch the film.Yes the film had it's flaws the whole Lanka protrayl was bad and one dialogue from hanuman doesn't make the whole good movie into a bad one. The film had it's moments and most of the part it sticks to the history on par
The vfx looked good for the 90cent of the part
Everyone actor did their job well
Ajay atul.the soul of the film stands out tall
Om did half of the job very well with some good vision in most of the parts
Prabhas was good in his given role and so did kriti
Could be more emotional but enough to a satisfy a person who has their own mind and opinion. Go for it for a one time. Decent watch in 3d.

Clearly the cast, writer, director should be rewarded with the same fate of the workers post taj mahal construction after creating this masterpiece. A lot of money has been pumped in to save face with paid ratings, copyright strikes and legal notices. Clearly they are trying to control narrative on the film. It completely shatters the timeless legend on ramayana.There's no limit on how naive and stupid the dialogues are. A ten year old would do a better job at it. There's every reason to not watch and promote this film. Absolutely distasteful and complete trash. And the brainless trash cans out there who say this is just good entertainment and VFX, there are plenty of better VFX movies out there, go watch it. You have no right to mess with someone's religion.

And yes maybe once or twice there might be flaws, but how do you expect someone to write a whole epic in just a three hours movie. Hats off to Om Raut to finally make a movie, at least someone made a movie. You guys keep criticising all these hindu promoting films and that is the reason there are no films in the making.Please learn to appreciate or you don't deserve watching these films.

""Adipurush"" is a regrettable endeavor that seeks to malign the sacredness of our revered epic, the Ramayana. It leaves a significant black mark on the piousness and sanctity cherished by ardent followers of Sanatana Dharma, both in India and across the globe. Despite the mess created by the team, they display audaciousness by releasing the film, and instead of offering an apology, some members even attempt to justify their actions on a news platform, trying to sugarcoat the flaws they have served to the audience. In conclusion, ""Adipurush"" fails as an attempt to honor and represent the revered epic, Ramayana. Its disrespectful execution tarnishes the sanctity of the source material and disappoints devout followers worldwide. It is a regrettable production that should be avoided in favor of more authentic and respectful adaptations available through literary works and well-established television series and films. Shri Ramanand Sagar's Ramayana TV Series (1987) and Yogo Sako et al. Ramayana: The Legend of Prince Rama (1992).

Adipurush disappoints as an adaptation of Ramayana. Characters lack depth, the story fails to convey its philosophical essence, cultural inaccuracies abound, visual effects are unconvincing, and the pacing is disjointed. A shallow and misguided tribute to a timeless epic.One of the most glaring issues with Adipurush is its mishandling of character development. The iconic characters from Ramayana, such as Lord Rama, Sita, and Ravana, are reduced to mere caricatures of their true selves.The Director and Writer should be banned from Bollywood Industry at least for 5/6 years.... This is lesson to all the Directors who will make any movie based on Indian epic. This punishment should be given for deliberately misguiding the public sentiments.

In this movie Laguage of every character is very low language and story is not like Ramyana its like a video game. Hanuman is our most worshipable god and our source of inspiration and such language does not suit him and in the name of modernizing it, the whole story of Ramayana has been changed. To complete the story in 3 hours, Laxman fainted on the very first day and Inderjeet, Kumbhkaran and Ravana were killed on the second day. They are saying to Hanuman in the garden, this is your aunt's garden. And when Laxman faints, Vibhishan's wife becomes valid and Sanjeevini does less and more of the bush. The entire story of Puri was wrong. Changed the entire Ramayana from the first scene to the last. Jatayu Vadh, Sita Haran, Swarna Marg, I think that no parents should show this Ramayana to their children. Ramayana is our culture, this film is a play on it.

urge you to ignore the reviews from rotten tom etc as they have no clue what Indians really apprecIte in the storyline . It was euphoric and emotional and some

This movie shows Om Raut capabilities to handle a project of this magnitude, he totally failed in this. He copied everything other than from Ramayana.He beleived that movie will be good only on below factors
1. Starcast
2. Great Story
3. Great fan following for actors
4. Great devotion in people for God Rama
5. Great MusicHowever he forgot that he is the captain of the ship and everything this depends on his capabilities of assembling above in perfect direction. Which he lacked.Further it seems he made this movie only for commercial purposes and did not had a single strain of devotion towards God Rama. If he had that then he would have made blockbuster movie.Negative points
1. Prabhas despite of having good screen presense didn't had dialogues with him, he was emotion less in whole movie
2. Lakshmana too didn't had many dialogues,in fact movie lacked conversation within the characters
3. Screen play very poor , felt like watching movie in fast forward mode.4. Pathetic road side tapori dialoges for hanuman and Inderjeet
5. Wrong portrayal of inderjeet , Kumbhakaran, Bhibhisan and his wife.6. Wrong facts portrayal in the movies
7. Action also not engaging and lacked the bahubali kind of kick.8. That era was for bow and arrow kind of war , however only Raghav and shesh were having that , others are using axe, sword or gada.9. Ravana lanka was golden but here it was Black
10. All negative Characters were wearing black
11. Sexualized Bhibhisan wife is totally unacceptableI have so many negative points that it's impossible to write here , only one suggestion either watch Ramayan serial or Ramayan anime (Japanese)
You can also read ramayan amarrchitrkatha comics or valmiki Ramayana.

It is absolutely pathetic how they ruined an epic just like it's no big deal. Serious lack of conviction is aptly visible in this doomed project.I couldn't believe why they would release such kind of a product. If the young minds of today get their understanding of Valmiki Ramayana from this movie then I don't know what will happen in near future.If this will be their Raavan then i don't know what exactly will they think of Ramayana in the first place. Absolutely lack luster VFX isn't the only problem with this film. Rather VFX is much less of a problem in this movie. The main flaw is in this representation that has been made by the makers. Raavan has an attire of an islamic dictator. He has been shown wearing a t-shirt along with leather straps over him with spiky hairstyle and rather non-sense get up. He is shown riding a bat but there is no mention of why he is riding a bat, is that pushpak vimaan or what. Characters around him are just goofy men or rather cartoons in his army who behave like lord of the rings character. Indrajit is shown as a guy having powers of Flash and attire of Connor McGregor. I can't imagine this being Ramayana.The first point of Introduction of Rama is pathetic. Shree Ram is shown as fighting some random CGI demons. Who are they? Why are they attacking Sita? Nothing is told as if it's a cartoon film. Even with such a story like that of Ramayana, Raavana's motivations are so childish and vague that we still don't know what he wants. We are shown a scene worth of 2 mins where Ravana's sister gets her nose cut by Laxman's arrow. That scene is so childish. Every detail about Rama's vanvaas is shown to us in a 3 minutes introduction. The movie doesn't want you to connect with any character. The most connected I was to a character was Jatayu which was just for a 3 minutes CGI sequence. Still I was more connected to it than Sita maa, Shree Ram or any one else.Even walking Saif Ali khan is shown us with CGI. As if his head is floating on a computer generated body leave alone the 10 head animation. Shree Ram's character is shown very much like a robot which is programmed to react in a certain way. I refuse to even think of this movie as Ramayana and any of the character as the one in Ramayana.In the end Ravan is killed by Rama but how did Rama know about shooting an arrow in his belly? Why didn't Ravan confronted Rama after this? A whole CGI climax of 30 minutes in a movie of 3 hours where the main essence of the story is skipped which doesn't allow you to connect with any character properly is the fundamental wrong with this film.Dialogues are pathetic. They are using slang language in their conversations. At one point they talk in Shudhh Hindi at other point they just start talking in slangs. Hanuman ji uses phrases like ""jalegi tere baap ki"", ""Lanka laga denge"" and is being told that ""ye teri bua ka bageecha hai ki tu tehelne aa gaya"". These dialogues are just the tip of the iceberg. A dialogue by Indrajit goes as ""mere ek sapola ne tere shesh naag ko lamba kardiya"". Now if you don't think this was intentional then I don't know what shows their intention.Overall this movie is an unbareable garbage which no devotee of Shree Rama or any person in general deserves to witness and atleast not by spending money. Don't watch it.

Utterly disgusting portrait of important characters and completely misses the point of Ramayana to teach people about the qualities of an ideal person possessed by Maryada Purushottam Shri Ram.Movie is just made for the purpose of extracting money from the Hindus by taking advantage of their religious beliefs. No effort is made to do the proper research about the character that how they look, how they behave, what they wear, nothing. They just moved on with the first thought that came in their mind.This movie should be boycotted. People should make sure that their kids do not watch this movie otherwise their perspective of Ramayana will be completely skewed. They should either watch the Ramanand Sagar's Ramayana which is freely available on YouTube or watch the animated movie, Ramayana: The Legend of Prince Rama made by Yugo Sako.

Hats Off to the imagination of each characters in totally different way which people would have never thought of. Unique way of depicting a story. Each characters have given their best to fulfil the role. Raavan at its best. The way his imagination is superb and acting is marvelous. Always from the childhood had a imagination of this story in a very different way but in movie can visualise the entire opposite side of it which looks really unique for the movie. Not everything can be covered in 3 hours. Whatever is tried to convey in the movie is truly amazing and really liked that unique thinking. Finally it's a Very well formed movie. Loved it and Worth watching it.

Let's dive deeper into the reasons why this film left me thoroughly disappointed.Lackluster Storytelling and Screenplay:One of the major flaws plaguing Adipurush is its lackluster storytelling and weak screenplay. The film attempts to retell the epic tale of Ramayana, a narrative that is ingrained in the cultural fabric of India. However, the narrative fails to captivate and engage the audience. The pacing is uneven, with significant gaps in the storyline that leave viewers perplexed and disconnected. The characters lack depth and development, making it difficult to emotionally invest in their journey. The film could have benefitted from a more focused and engaging screenplay that effectively conveyed the essence of theDespite a star-studded cast, the performances in Adipurush leave much to be desired. Prabhas, known for his charismatic presence, fails to shine as Lord Rama. His portrayal lacks the emotional depth and conviction required to bring the character to life. Similarly, Saif Ali Khan's performance as Ravana falls flat. The iconic villain is reduced to a caricature, lacking the complexity and intensity that would make him a worthy adversary. The supporting cast does little to salvage the film, with forgettable performances that fail to leave a lasting impression. Overall, the lack of compelling performances only adds to the film's mediocrity.One would expect a film of this scale to boast impressive visual effects, but sadly, Adipurush disappoints in this department as well. The CGI (computer-generated imagery) used throughout the film is often jarring and unconvincing. The mythical creatures and grand battle sequences, meant to be awe-inspiring, come across as amateurish and disjointed. The poor execution of visual effects detracts from the overall viewing experience and makes it difficult to immerse oneself in the world of Adipurush.The director's vision plays a pivotal role in bringing a story to life on the big screen. In the case of Adipurush, the direction seems to be lacking a clear sense of purpose. The film veers between tones, unsure of whether it wants to be a grand epic or a commercial entertainer. This lack of coherence is evident in the disjointed narrative and inconsistent characterization. The director fails to provide a cohesive vision that could have elevated Adipurush to its potential greatness.Adipurush, being an adaptation of a revered Hindu epic, carries a responsibility to handle its source material with utmost respect and sensitivity. Unfortunately, the film falters in this regard. Certain creative liberties taken in the name of storytelling come across as insensitive and disrespectful to the religious sentiments associated with the Ramayana. These choices, instead of adding depth, alienate a significant section of the audience, and contribute to the overall disappointment of the film.In conclusion, Adipurush fails to live up to its grand promises and falls short on multiple fronts. Its lackluster storytelling, weak screenplay, underwhelming performances, incoherent visual effects, and cultural insensitivity make it a disappointing cinematic experience. As an audience member, I was left longing for a film that could do justice to the epic tale of Ramayana. Sadly, Adipurush does not fulfill that longing and instead offers aforgettable rendition of a beloved story.

I suggest not to watch this movie and don't encourage them for making fun of our religion and emotions. In this way at least they will understand that not only topic but also story and acting are necessary in a movie. They will also understand that just because of the name of religion they can not make a superhit movie. It also needs emotions, dialogues, acting and the actors who fit in the role. In this movie actors don't fit in the role, the dialogues are very cheap, VFX effects are not good and most important thing the story line doesn't even match the real Ramayan. So, I prefer not to watch the movie.

Manoj Muntashir what the hell u have made .....?Can't have worst depiction of holy ramayana than this movie Out of Context and Derogatory dialoguesAdipurush is merely a Bollywood-ised version of one of the most epic tales that ever existed. If you keep the story aside for it's largely known to all, the execution turns out to be a messy blend of over-the-top CGI and passable VFX, and making it worse are the intentionally funny dialogues that sound misplaced in a sensitive and mythological story. Why would you want Hanuman to say 'Jalegi tere baap ki'?""Better to watch the ancient Ramayana rather then wasting time on this so called Epic.

It feels like it has been intentionally made to criticize Ramayana and Hinduism. The Dialogues are pathetic and unsuitable to such worshiped characters.The screenplay is uneven and sometimes drags in the first half, while the second half is packed with too many events and twists but nonsense. The dialogues are often cliched and melodramatic, especially in the emotional scenes. The editing could have been tighter and smoother, as some transitions are abrupt and jarring. The CGI effects are also inconsistent and sometimes look cheap and unconvincing, especially in the scenes involving animals and mythical creatures.May Hanuman ji bring down the producer and director under his mighty Gada! So they never every thing to make something like this in janmo janam.

Wonderful movie, stunning visuals and 3d effects....
As in the movie beginning desclaimer has been shown for the illiterate people who is spreading hatred and negativity but also they don't understand it is an adaption and made changes as per the present nativity. Movie message is same but presentation may vary for time to time and person to person it can't be presented in the sam old movies or serials. Ramayana has many version and the director has shown in his version and view. Movie was good and this north people don't digest if South hero movies become blockbuster so they spread negative reviews.

Title: Deep Disappointment in the Movie AdipurushRating: ⭐I recently had the opportunity to watch the movie Adipurush, and I must express my deep disappointment regarding the artistic choices made by the filmmakers. It is disheartening to witness the shocking level of depravity displayed in creating this movie. It begs the question: Om Raut and Manoj Muntasir, were you attempting to turn the sacred Ramayana into a comedy genre? The disrespect shown towards such a revered epic is truly regrettable, and I feel compelled to express my disapproval of this project and everyone involved.Additionally, the VFX effects used in the movie were underwhelming and failed to meet even basic standards. They appeared amateurish, comparable to something a high school student who has just learned a few tricks from YouTube might create for casual entertainment. The entire claimed budget of 600 crores feels like a complete farce, raising concerns about possible financial irregularities. It is my sincere belief that the appropriate authorities, such as the ED, should investigate any potential money laundering angles.Furthermore, I take exception to Manoj M's claim that Katha Vachaks in India utilize such language. Throughout my life, I have heard numerous Katha Vachaks who narrate the stories of the Ramayana with utmost respect and reverence. Never have I encountered anyone resorting to insults or disrespectful depictions of the holy Ramayana or its cherished characters.In conclusion, Adipurush has left a bitter taste, failing to honor the sacredness and dignity of the Ramayana. It is disheartening to witness such a misguided attempt to portray a beloved epic. I hope that future filmmakers approach these revered stories with the respect and artistic integrity they deserve.I wish IMdb gives an option to say ""Movie not worth ANY Rating"".

In terms of visual effects, it is the best Indian film to date. All of the actors are fantastic. If you compare VFX in terms of Marvel movies, how has an Indian film generated such good effects? You, too, are overjoyed. The darkness in the film is due to visual effects. They may not have as much funding right now .This film features outstanding visual effects. We should be proud of all the technicians and studios in India who have created such immaculate VFX effects. I haven't bored a single scene. All of the firms that have done VFX effects are Indian. Go see the film and make India proud. Otherwise no Indian movie can dare to compete the VFX effects with Marvel movies of Hollywood. We should encourage this movie 's producers, actors and directors who has vision to compete with Hollywood market.

Director spend all 600 crore in watching Marvel movie in this whole year and copy scene from them . This show how poor creative idealization that man has toward making content for his own films. Neither director i think ever read the really Ramayana . And make that movie which is used for cringe.

I was bit skeptical to watch this movie after hearing lots of negative reviews, but guys believe, it's not that worst. Our family did really enjoy the movie. VFX and Sound track is really very good. All the actors everyone have given their best performance. As it's a movie and it's very difficult to extend the movie more than 3hrs ,so they tried cut short many dialogues and scenes which is really great. One negative thing which i noticed was Names of the characters. As a Tamil person, We are well familiar with Rama, Sita, Hanuman but in the movie they call main characters differently which is the only drawback. However, apart from all these small mistakes, the movie delivering the spectacular visuals and music. Overall, I can't say this is the best but I can say very good 💯.

Sure, here is a negative review of the movie Adipurush in 600 words:Adipurush is a 2023 Indian epic mythological film based on the Hindu epic Ramayana. The film is directed by Om Raut and stars Prabhas as Lord Rama, Kriti Sanon as Sita, Saif Ali Khan as Ravana, Sunny Singh as Lakshman, Devdatta Nage as Hanuman, and Vatsal Sheth as Indrajit.The film begins with a prologue that sets the scene for the story. We are introduced to the characters of Rama, Sita, and Ravana, and we learn about their respective origins and motivations. The prologue is well-made and sets the tone for the rest of the film.The main story of the film follows Rama as he sets out to rescue Sita from Ravana. The film does a good job of following the basic plot of the Ramayana, but it also takes some creative liberties. For example, the film introduces a new character named Lankesh, who is Ravana's son and a powerful warrior. Lankesh is a welcome addition to the story, and he provides some much-needed conflict for Rama.However, the film's creative liberties are not all welcome. For example, the film changes the ending of the Ramayana, and this change is unnecessary and unsatisfying. The film also adds some unnecessary violence and gore, which is jarring and off-putting.The VFX in Adipurush are also disappointing. The film's battle scenes are particularly poorly-done, and the special effects look cheap and fake. The CGI is also used to create some unrealistic and unbelievable moments, which takes away from the overall enjoyment of the film.Overall, Adipurush is a flawed film. The performances are good, and the story is mostly faithful to the Ramayana. However, the film's creative liberties are unnecessary and unsatisfying, and the VFX are disappointing. I would not recommend Adipurush to anyone, not even fans of the Ramayana.Here are some specific criticisms of the film:* The film's ending is a major departure from the Ramayana, and it is unsatisfying and anticlimactic.* The film adds unnecessary violence and gore, which is jarring and off-putting.* The VFX in the battle scenes are poorly-done, and the CGI looks cheap and fake.* The film uses CGI to create some unrealistic and unbelievable moments, which takes away from the overall enjoyment of the film.I would give Adipurush a rating of 1 out of 10tars. It is a flawed film that is not worth your time or money.

Had been waiting to see the movie like everyone else and despite reading such bad reviews, took the family to see the movie.Had read someone correctly describe the movie and that was the review that pushed me to go see the movie irrespective of the bad reviews ; it said that its different from the Ramayana that we all grew up watching on Sundays but for the next gen kids its an unabridged version which covers everything important and keeps them engaged.Its admirable how they have covered all the important events into a 3 hour movie and have not wasted time dragging anything.The VFX is impressive and our children were able to understand what happened and sat through the whole movie.I agree that there are some dialogues that make you cringe and I am surprised that despite the reviews, the directors/writers did not put an effort to quickly correct and re-release the movie. But its unfair to judge the whole movie based on a handful of dialogues.Do not listen to anyone's reviews and go watch the movie and judge yourself.

Please don't watch it. It's better to watch the old Ramayana instead of Adipurush. I was watching the movie on Netflix but could even watch for more than 10 min. Nothing against the actors but it should be more natural instead of adding VFX. The legend actors in these movie should have done something at the time of editing the movie. The producer & Director need to rethink for the movie. I would request to them please don't do the experiment for the rich history of indian Ramayana in future as it's famous all over the world. I would urge to watch the old Ramayana which is been created in 90s era.

500 crores to make a movie that can be compared to my game trailers. They could have hired professionals to make the movie. Or I think blender youtubers can make it better if they had the budget. There is no fault to actors because they are doing what they are told to. So, I think criticizing the actors is not a good thing. Conclusion is that they had the resources, but they are unable to use it. Also, I think if they had copied and pasted it form actually RAMAYANA, I think that would also look nice, but what can we say I thought they have improved it, but they adjust the contrast and saturation.

Very poor adaptation. Poor writing. Facts not presented. Poorly directed. This movie should not be considered a depiction of Ramayana because they totally changed points like when Ravan was to be killed Vibhishan told lord ram where to attack. Angad was a very important character they missed him out completely. Ravan lanka was of gold not black. They literally took The palace from Thor ragnarok and made it black from golden. They were showing powers like Ravan had assembled avengers in himself and not to forget Indrajeet. They made a joke out of him and how should we forget about the pushpak viman or the bat he was riding on. Simply Disgusting. Only reason i wantched was because of Prabhas and Kriti sanon because this is not a part of Ramayana.

686,27 June 2023," I'm glad I didn't go by the negative reviews!!
","
I usually don't write reviews but seeing all the negativity spread about this movie really saddens me, hence I had to write this review.My family and I really enjoyed this movie. It's a complete entertainer. And Saif Ali Khan...take a bow, what a performance!!! He completely overshadowed others. Yes, Hanuman could have been portrayed a bit better, nonetheless it doesn't at all down my overall impression about the movie.The VFX has been criticized a lot but the improved VFX are indeed very impressive, particularly in 3D version.We have grown up seeing Sh. Ramanand Sagar's Ramayan, the Ramleela, and the 10 headed Ravan dahan whose 10 heads are arranged in a linear array. So it's easy to stereotype any presentation that is based on the Ramayan and we tend to compare everything with what we have seen and been taught since childhood. But please stop stereotyping and try to look from a different perspective. Presenting Ravan with 5 upper and 5 lower heads is indeed very creative and unique and never seen before. The Laxman rekha was also given a modern makeover which was also very innovative thought.Many say that a lot has been copied from Hollywood movies like planet of the apes etc. Why don't anyone say that planet of the apes was inspired from Ramayan? Just because they showcased talking monkeys in a movie before us doesn't mean we copied from them. Its only that our technology is far behind them but we are fast catching up. Talking animals have featured in our storybooks such as Panchatantra even before Hollywood started making such movies. Copying and taking inspiration are different things. I don't see anything wrong in taking inspiration from anywhere as long as its not a ditto replica of the original. As a video game lover, I could easily recognize that the character of Indrajeet, the electrifying effects, superpowers, among many other things, were inspired from God of War game, the rolling blades on the walls of Lankan fortress and monkeys trying to dodge them might have been inspired from the Prince of Persia game. But that's ok, we all take inspiration from things around us. Appreciate the hard work gone into making this movie a visual treat rather than criticizing it.Yes, some dialogues were indeed objectionable and not worthy of such a holy and pious epic. Apart from that, its definitely a winner for me.Stop stereotyping and you will love the movie!

687,12 August 2023," Looks like if Warner Bros and Marvel collaborated to make the movie

This movie has so many elements from different movies. In programmers terms it's like if they took Transformers, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Ender's Game, Game of Thrones, and Planet of Apes and ran ""git merge"" on them then layered a sad excuse of the Ramayana on top of it to resolve the conflicts. The giant bats of Raavan make no sense. If it actually resembled the Ramayana I might have at least given it 5 stars but I ended up focusing more on the stupidity and inaccuracies rather than the actual story. This is a complete and utter insult to the Ramayana. I find it difficult to see how you could even make a movie this bad.

This abomination masquerading as a film, Adipurush, is a disgrace to cinematic artistry. The creators have managed to butcher one of the most revered epics of all time with their utter lack of understanding and respect for the source material. It's as if they handed the Ramayana to a group of preschoolers armed with crayons and asked them to reinterpret it.The portrayal of Prabhas as a clownish caricature of a hero is an insult to his talent and the legacy of the character he's supposed to embody. Hanuman, a majestic and divine figure, has been reduced to a buffoonish SpongeBob lookalike, an absurdity that defies any logical explanation. And don't even get me started on Ravan - the menacing antagonist of the Ramayana transformed into a chapri street goon? This is an affront to storytelling and cultural heritage.Om Raut, the so-called director, should be stripped of his title for this travesty. His creative decisions are baffling at best and utterly disrespectful at worst. It's abundantly clear that he possesses neither the vision nor the competence to handle a project of this magnitude. The fact that such a blunder was allowed to reach the silver screen is a testament to the incompetence of the producers who greenlit this disaster.The absence of crucial scenes from the exile and the complete disregard for the origin of Sita further highlight the contempt with which this film treats its source material. It's as if the filmmakers deliberately set out to mock and undermine the rich narrative tapestry of the Ramayana.In the name of all that is sacred, stay far away from this cinematic abomination. Adipurush is a disgraceful mockery of a cherished epic, a shameful waste of resources, and an insult to every viewer's intelligence. It's an embarrassment to the world of filmmaking and a stain on the legacy of the Ramayana.

It was such a great opportunity to carry forward the legacy of Ramanand Sagar's Ramayan and narrate the story in an effective way. However what a crass attempt it is! Cynical it may sound but this seems to be an attempt to cash on the hindu-sentiments without having an actual conviction!God's own way of filtering what stories are to be told! I wonder whether this movie even deserve an OTT.Just checked OM Raut's (Producer + Director + Screenplay writer) wiki page which says that this movie generally received positive feedback from critics. Definitely some craft work going on with wikipedia as I didn't find a single positive comment atleast so far on IMDB.

Horrible and pathetic. Director, Producer and write must apologise entire public for executing this story.

""Adipurush"" astounds with its audacious ambition but falls short in execution. The visual effects, while impressive in scale, struggle to blend seamlessly with the live-action scenes, resulting in jarring moments that take viewers out of the experience. The film's attempt to reimagine an epic tale is evident, yet the script occasionally falters, leaving character arcs underdeveloped and emotional depth lacking. However, the performances, especially by the lead actors, manage to shine through the tumultuous CGI, injecting some authenticity into the mythological narrative. ""Adipurush"" proves that grand visions don't always translate into greatness, leaving audiences torn between marveling at the effort and lamenting the missed potential.

There cud not be anyone better than The Gigantic yet Soft Prabhas for RAM
I'm certain that the Kids and Adult's both wud enjoy the Visual experience if only u ignore the Critic negative propaganda

This movie was incredible! What a heck of an experience. It's a journey of epic, LOTR fantasy conflict proportions. It felt like a mashup of elements from King Kong, Planet of the Apes, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Marvel, but set in another culture.At times the animation quality is visibly aged, but the pure, wild enthusiasm this movie throws at every part of the story absolutely blows that away. Beginning to end, I was continually caught by delighted surprise. (What was with the giant goose chariot at the end??) It was a very interesting, creative illustration of an ancient Sanskrit epic, Ramayana. I've never heard of it, but now I want to know more!

Not up to the mark. This seems like very ambitious project to showcase a monumental episode of sanatan history and it couldn't live up to the expectations. There are lot of nuances which were missing and honestly you cannot fit this huge of a story in 3 hours.Ramayana is coded in our systems and anything remotely close to it will get criticism if not shown properly. I remember crying at scenes where both Ravan and kumbhkaran die given both return to their original self ex egos when on death bed. I believe this movie missed the subtle nuances which affects the whole experience.Could have been better.

A concious attempt has been made to modify the Ramayan. It has gone so past the limit that it has ultimately led to falsification of the entire story. The sentiments of people who believe in Lord Ram and take inspiration from Ramayan is shaken to the core.I wish I had an option to give zero or negative marking and I would have happily done that. It's such a shame that Indian Cinema is so commercialized now that they don't even hesitate to make something like this.I recommend everyone who has watched this to please watch Ramanand Sagar's Ramayana if they want to cherish the glory of our holy scripture and valour, love and grace of Lord Ram. May Lord Ram bless all of us who who have watched even a scene of this movie. Jai Shree Ram!

I also love the part where a person with incredible speed comes. It looked like something out of Marvel or DC. I thought effects like these only worked in anime or any type of animation, but I was clearly proved wrong. It turns out that the effects were actually good and that the animation worked out and looked good towards the final presentation. Wow man, just wow.

But no it was made so poorly, the dialogues were cringe, the CGI was from 1998, it was terrible. I didn't grown reading ramayan so there was a lot going on that I didn't understand. This could have been a multi part epic if the creator spend some more time character building and working on the effects. Like the vanars were so poorly done and so were the asuras they made them look like poor orcs from lord of the rings. All they are to do was reference any of the planet of the apes movies or something and then they would have been may be a lil embarrassed to release a poorly done beautiful story.Okay I'm done ranting!!

Not one real location used and it will hit you throughout the movie (if you manage to sit through it). Religious song stanzas used in critical scenes to evoke emotions and it fails miserably. Prabhas is difficult to bear even for a minute. Sunny singh should stick to the Sonu ke Titu kinds. He literally has no expression on his face at all. Ravan was too fancy and sports a spiked hair with beard styled from a designer. Even his walk is animated. The director, Om Raut and writer, Manoj Muntashir should be punished for making a joke and playing with the religious sentiments of the people.AVOID .. AVOID .. AVOID !!!!

Ravana looks like a Talibani and Hanumana is a joke. Even a child can make a better movie. Hanumana was innocent not stupid.

A really bad movie made wasting so much money.Story does not depict original Ramayan. Even Ravan was praised in original for his bhakti and knowledge. Here his character is completely destroyed to fit into graphics, which is also horrible and laughable. Costumes also depicted like modern day and kriti sonan is doing some modelling work.

Direction theri baap ke, script theri baap ke, VFX bhi teri BAAP ki.This film should be BANNED. Copy from marvel, Pathetic VFX, Pathetic screen play. Made a JOKE of Hindu belief.Already started hate bollywood movies. This film should be given to SS Rajamouli, the one and only director in India who is able to do this kind of film.Script writer still proud of what he did !!. This guy should be in prison for what he did to Hindu culture. Dialogues from Hanuman !!!! How can he justifie this??Will not watch any more bollywood movies.. such a shame..
Can enjoy the songs, Thats it Dont watch!!!!!!!!!

Absolutely bogus... they have ruined the every fact of Ramayan...very disappointed...
So in my point of view don't take this movie as epic... it's just for entertainment... like a fictional super hero...
Most important thing is that the dialogues are absolutely low graded and even sometimes laughable...
The sets of the movie are also absolutely low graded and far away from the facts of epic Ramayan... Yes some special effects are used but seriously... those are nothing but laughable...
So finally in my opinion watching this movie is totally wastage of money and also wastage of time... it is a completely flop movie...

These people should read Ramayan first to know the importance. Directors and specially actors should be ashamed of working in this movie. Na utter shame to all the cast for mocking the Great Ramayan.People should bycot this movie. And these actors should not be allowed to work more in India.Prabhas is a great actor but not sure how he was convinced to work in this movie mocking the Characters of Ramayan. I believe south film industry is devoted to Indian culture but witnessing such a disgrace & disgusting movie.Not sure how this movie collected hundreds of crores people should be boycotting this from the very first day of release.

If you haven't watched the worst movie of your life, then you need to watch this. This is not a movie, it's a shame. Such a mockery of deep rooted Hindu culture and mythology. It's an effort worth punishing. Horrendous attempt. Never thought I could see Ramayan being transformed into such a bad version. This is the worst of everything. From cast, screenplay, misrepresentation, oh! Can't miss the worst CGI ever! You'll find it all in this movie. I wish I could get back 3 hours of my life back. What a Royal waste of time this movie was. I'm sure the intention was to copy all Hollywood movies, mix it with the epic Hindu mythological story and they thought they have a formula of a hit machine. 700 crores and they couldn't make a decent movie!

Truly disappointing- Expectation was my kids would learn about our history, but...I would have really appreciated if this would have been a summary of the original Ramayana series, as in todays fast place world kids may not be able to watch the complete series.Depicting all Ramayana's character on truly how they were, their aacharan, their thoughts and how can we correlate and learn from them in today's world should have been the goal of this movie. I am pretty sure everyone would have appreciated that.Not always try to make money, but make movies inspirational for our young generation and they should be inspired and motivated to bring name and fame for our country wherever they go...We shouldn't be teaching such pathetic language used in this movie... This can never be a public demand, as public would always want a better future for their kids and young people.I hope all the reviews are loud and clear, but everyone involved in making this movie shouldn't be disappointed as it's not the end of the world, and everyone should try and strive to make another movie that touches the heart and soul of the audience and everyone will appreciate the same team if you can truly make such efforts.

Here are few things that are wrong with this film for the very first 1 hour.Warning: Spolers Ahead1. The first 20 minutes don't make sense and the introduction of Rama is pure cringe with cheap copies of characters from Harry Potter.2. Dialogues between Rama and Sita look like they have been written by a 15 Year old Salman Khan fan. ""Sita : Bus badi badi baatein karte Hain aap"", Bade aaye"" SERIOUSLY?? WHO ARE YOU EVEN TALKING TO?3. Bad introduction of Ravan. The sequence of stone structures of Ravan singing and Saif playing sitar layak electric guitar makes Thugs of Hindostaan look good.4. Such bad CGI of Lanka that it looks like a video game from the year 2000.5. Poorly written dialogues between Rama and other characters.WHAT THE HELL IS A JUNGLI BUDHIYA?6. Sugriv's animated character has been copied straight from Ceaser from Planet of the Apes. They didn't even bother to make something new.7. While the fight of Bali and Sugriv was good and has been well thought of even though it's short the bad CGI of both characters make it look immensely bad.There are so many other bad things and worse things about this picture. Would add some points later here.
